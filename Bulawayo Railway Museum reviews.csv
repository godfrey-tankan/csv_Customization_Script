"Wonderfully engaging for me, and engineer but not a railway buff.",2017-06-28
I have been to the York Railway Museum but found my recent visit to the Bulawayo Railway Museum to be more fascinating and enjoyable. Gordon who showed us around was a font of knowledge and his passion for all things railway was evident when speaking to him. The highlight was being able to go into Cecil John Rhodes personal carriage. Being able to climb onto the Garratt class and other locomotives is not something you will do at York Railway Museum.,2013-04-07
"The museum is an absolutely amazing place, huge, full of exhibits showcasing the history of railways in Zimbabwe.I spent a fascinating over 3 hours there, and I could have spent twice as much.",2018-07-26
A stunning place of history. We enjoyed an hour of walking in between old coaches and trains. It's fun to discover the place and learn about Zimbabwean railways history. Make sure you visit Gordon at the office and listen to some stunning stories about Bulawayo and the rest of the country. The place is definitely worth a visit and a great opportunity to support the work they're doing on preserving former times.,2021-06-09
"For a very nominal entry fee of 2US$ it was well worth a visit. The curator Gordon Murray was very welcoming and there is a lot see (but donâ€™t expect the NRM at York!). You can get hands on with the exhibits, on the footplates etc. and there is a pump cart you are free to try your hand with. My partner thought it great fun!",2017-01-21
"It was a beautiful enlightening experience rich in history and culture. The tour guide is part of the history being told, which makes it even more fascinating.",2019-10-09
What a treat. This place was much more than I hoped for. It had many trains from the beginning of rail history of Zimbabwe. The highlight of the museum is Mr Rhodes personal train car from the late 1800s. If you're in town this is a must see. It is run without any help from the government so if you can afford to make a donation to help with the upkeep.,2013-10-23
"A MUST visit! Wow! Went in for a quick one and spent 3 wonderful hours. The site is extraordinary and a true journey through time. Gordon Murray is part and parcel of it all and a true 'train man' and he has done a fantastic job overseeing since retiring from the Rhodesia/ Zimbabwe railroads. Cecil Rhodes personal car is the major - that would be a trophy for any major museum - but there is far, far more... plan for at least a couple of hours with pic opportunities a aplenty...",2016-07-02
"This is a wonderful museum for any interested in trains, but it is much more than that.  This museum really drives home how important trains were to the creation of the modern state.  As you tour the museum, you get a really good picture of the last 150 years of history, from a British colony to modern Zimbabwe.  I highly recommend this place.",2022-01-09
"We liked our visit very much! You are able to climb inside a lot of historic trains, learn about the interesting rhodesian/zimbabwean railway history, drive yourself on a trolley and sit inside cecile rohdes private luxury coach. Gordon, the friendly guy who runs the museum, can answer all your questions and show you around.",2015-03-19
"Being shown the locomotives and carriages by Mr Gordon Murray, the Manager and Curator, was an exceptional treat. Gordon is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, volunteering technical and historical information.",2015-07-07

Amazing and Wonderful morning spent with a passionate human being called Mr Gordon Murray.He knows so much about the history of the train in Zimbabwe ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¼ that it was for us like a long trip throughout space and time. We want to thank him so much for his patience and dedication.Without him the visit wouldnâ€™t have been the same...We advise anyone whoâ€™s intended to go to Bulawayo to go and visit that museum and ask for Mr Gordon Murray.....,2023-12-24
Better than you think,2014-11-06
The reason I came here was to see Cecil Rhodes' railway couch.  But there is a lot more than that here.  The curator is especially helpful.,2017-03-08
Bulawayo Railway Museum,2015-02-28
The railway museum in Bulawayo is very impressive.  The furnishings of a hundred-year-old railway stations with steam locomotive and locomotives of later times have been preserved thanks to the incredible efforts of Mr. Gordon.  I strongly advise everyone to visit the museum,2021-06-11
2016 visit,2022-05-20
"What a wonderful experience. Gordon Murray is a font of railroad knowledge. Talking with him was a wonderful learning experience. Also, he remembered a couple of my brothers who were engine drivers in the 70s. My 7 year-old grandson had a great time there. Walking through the museum brought back some dear memories of traveling by railway in the 60s and 70s.Gordon, I still have your signed book.Desmond Pullen, Washington State,USA",2016-10-08
Impressive historical collection,2016-11-05
Amazingly well maintained despite scarce resources. Really interesting history of the railways in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe including Cecil Rhodes personal carriage. Kids would love this place as you get to climb onto the trains (@ your own risk).,2016-03-04

An amazing shift,2020-12-11
Within walking distance from center (recommend choice city BP). Nice place to discover great past of zimbabwean(Rhodesian) railways... Good idea to go there when arriving by train from vic falls or plan to go to vic from bulawayo by train. The train you take resembles the wagons in museum you still find the RR rhod. Railway logo in the train. Museum has a nice old white manager who is very very friendly. He gave us a map of Zimbabwe and first issue stamps (without any relation to railway) as a gift. So nice place and enjoy. You can easily visit the nature historic museum same afternoon just take taxi.,2016-02-14
"Super afternoon out - Gordon, the curator, is as friendly and helpful as anyone you'd hope to meet and he took us on a personalised tour for no charge. He's passionate and has a deep knowledge, and makes the place that much more interesting to visit. Plenty of history here, well worth the Z$2 entry!",2022-12-23
Amazing experience. Glad to meet Mr. Gordon who takes care of the place. Very near the city center and really worth the visit.,2023-04-07
"Whether you are a train-lover or not, you will find Bulawayo Railway museum fascinating. To begin with, it is one of the most visited attractions of Bulawayo. The highlights being Cecil Rhodes coach in mint conditionJack Tar, the first train to cross Victoria Falls bridge and plenty of newspapers and photographs from a long time ago. The enthusiastic curator (if you are lucky enough that he is around on the you are visiting) will personally show you around. The well-appointed coach of Cecil Rhodes is still is great condition - even the dining table is laid out, and you can see his bedroom and kitchen etc.Entry fee of USD 2 applies. The museum is open on all days.",2019-07-30
Thanks to Tripadvisor I visited this place. It turned out to be one of most beautiful place I visited in Bulawayo.Mr. Gordon has put his heart & soul in managing this place. He personally took us to each & every engine on display and explained every detail. Also gave some very good memorabilia on our way back. A must visit in Bulawayo.,2022-12-30
"Visited the museum yesterday on a work related reason, very impressed at how well it has been maintained.",2020-08-10
"The museum is close to the Bulawayo railway station about 20 min walk from town.I was welcomed by a very passionate and versed Gordon Murray that explained everything to me and lend me a book with all the information (no need to buy). The little entrance fee (2 USD) provided me plenty of surprises: a genuine 70's train ticket, some collectors stamps and all the friendly chat with Gordon. There are many coaches, wagons, locomotive, etc. on display and you can enter them.If you like trains and their history this is a must!",2017-09-20
This place is so wonderful you can tell the long roots of this place matter of fact I loved it so next time when I come will visit to it again,2016-01-10
"Even if you're not a trainspotter, you will still be wowed by Gordon's passion as curator. He worked on the railways for nigh on 40 years, knows the score inside out. His hands on guided tour, strolling round the yard of powerful old engines with their history; and through Rhodes' carriage with it's way ahead of its time ergonomical design - informative with a dry wit. And he hands out souvenirs of your visit. Among other interesting knick-knacks, I now have an old school Rhodesian Railways cardboard train ticket from 1975. Simple pleasures. A couple of hours well spent. Thank you Gordon.",2020-10-13
It was a refreshing and amazing visit for my children as they had such a memorable tour of the museum getting in and out of the engine asking all sorts of questions about NRZ.One of them wanted to have a feel of driving the engine asking how she can do it. Amazing coach works from the old to the new what a shift showing the development bof technology. It was such an informative visit that left us as parents laughing every time as our kids kept asking all sorts of silly but interesting questions. Another visit will do us good.,2021-01-01

"After a long week at work, visiting the museum was fun, great hospitality and a nice history lesson,",2017-08-09
the museum boasts antic coaches and locomotives that are nowhere else in the world to be seen. staff is friendly and helpfulwonderful place to spend the entire afternoon exploring and appreciating.,2014-09-22
"Awesome museum. Super fascinating. Really friendly host who shared an excellent guidebook on the trains. Easy and extensive exploration. Lots of trains, newspapers, and photographs from a long time ago. Surprising gem in Bulawayo. I would put this above Nesbitt and second to Matopos for touring Bulawayo.",2019-09-18
"There is so much history here and such a well put together exhibition that clearly only needs funding. The founders are the curators, and the staff are also there. My kids had such an incredible time here and I ended up delaying our exit thanks to Gordon Murray - founder and curator. Having him there and relating about the trains and the history of the museum is so special that money can't  even begin price. But just to show you the character of the place, if we could price it for three adults and three kids it would be $7 - but when the payment system wouldn't work they offered us to go in for free for the sake of our kids! I was not a train person going in, but now I am.",2019-10-16
"I am no railway enthusiast, but the past history of present day Zimbabwe is excellently displayed in this remarkable place. Gordon Murray is very entertaining and I hope this place will continue to inform new generations",2023-01-02
Such an interesting museum! Gordon Murray and Thandy are a fountain of knowledge. The museum is full of interesting and interactive displays. Do make a stop there - you won't regret it.,2013-04-16
"Ancient locomotives that you can climb onto, a maintenance trolley that you can still operate, Cecil Rhodes' private coach,the reconstrucion of an old railway station.These are among the wonderful and authentic attractions that make up the magic of this veritable gem. The enthusiastic caretaker, Mr Gordon Murray is part of the show with his learned memories and comments. Thanks to him this beautiful treasure lives on. Well done!",2018-03-30
"Had to stop by and see what history is layed out here,it's very educational and shows a lot about this country, from snakes,mining,sites and many more. Will recommend this place for travellers.",2022-03-19
"Very interesting place with lots of things to see including Rhodes' personal train coach (used to bring his coffin to the Matopos), the first locomotive to cross the bridge at Vic Falls and so much more.Run by volunteers (they're doing a great job considering how things have been going in Zim over the last few years). We had the pleasure to meet Gordon Murray who was manning the museum on that day. He is the nicest person you could meet and I'm sure he has lots of things to tell about railways in Zimbabwe and before when it was Rhodesia.We had a great time.",2016-07-18
"Excellent museum with interesting exhibits, especially the Rhodes carriage. Plenty of engines to climb in (at your own risk) but the highlight of the museum is Gordon Murray, the energy behind the museum. His enthusiasm for the railways and the museum is infectious and we had a good time chatting with him.",2018-03-25
