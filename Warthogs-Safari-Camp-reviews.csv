"Warthogs is great, I’m writing this review during my return stay. If you love relaxing and watching game, you’ll love the place. My wife and I stayed in the two person en suite tents. It is also convenient that food and drink is available too. Everyone, owners and all staff extremely friendly and helpful.",2019-09-06

The proprietress was kind and helpful. The food prepared by the cook was disastrous and has led to frequent use of the toilet. The midnight pool parties provided for sleepless nights.,2023-10-17
