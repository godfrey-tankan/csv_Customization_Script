Staff and owners are awesome. The amount of wildlife is n the area is great incredible. Will absolutely return.
The service was good and would recommend someone to visit this place
"Warthogs is great, I’m writing this review during my return stay. If you love relaxing and watching game, you’ll love the place. My wife and I stayed in the two person en suite tents. It is also convenient that food and drink is available too. Everyone, owners and all staff extremely friendly and helpful."
"Wayne and Louisa were very welcoming and the tent we stayed in was spotless, fresh and clean. The view over the Kariba and the animals walking in front of the property was very relaxing and beautiful"
We had a great stay @ Warthogs. the staff where professional and helpful. next time we will stay longer.
The proprietress was kind and helpful. The food prepared by the cook was disastrous and has led to frequent use of the toilet. The midnight pool parties provided for sleepless nights.
What a fabulous experience. Lovely setting and great food. An opportunity to get right up close to nature
