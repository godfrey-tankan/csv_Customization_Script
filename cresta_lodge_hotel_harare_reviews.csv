review
"Felt very safe. Was able to contact family all round the hotel as good wifi, everyone was helpful and polite"
The hotel is quite good in Zimbabwe. It's a bit pricey but it makes sense comparing the competition in the country. The wifi could be better but they far exceed my expectation. Quite calm and very friendly staff.
My stay there was super-duper. I can recommend the facilities to a friend when visiting Harare city. People there are friendly and available to every call.
I enjoyed my stay thouroughly.Would do it again if given another chance in the future .Maybe TV service could be better . Otherwise hats off to Cresta Lodge Harare.
My stay at Cresta Lodge was peaceful and enjoyable. The staff is so on point that you feel at home even if you are far from home. The environment is so soothing that you relax perfectly.
The place is beautiful and spacious and nice rooms. The have a wide range of food offers and they do not stick to the same food Manu. They ensure the rooms are clean and tight. The hotel view by the front and swimming pool is so refreshing and amazing.
This is a great clean place with great service. The staff are welcoming form the time you reach the reception. The food is good and nights are quiet.
Very good and quiet place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city church. Loved the serine environment with beautiful gardens. You could do better on your breakfast range especially the hot meals. Otherwise great place to stay.
"We spent 6 nights at Cresta Lodge and had an excellent experience. Staff are very friendly, the grounds are very peaceful, security is good. Breakfast buffet was great. Internet was fast and reliable."
"Generally, a good service from the reception, outlook of the hotel and cleanliness. However, there is need to improve on catering. The most important part of a guest's stay in a hotel is the food and how it is served. Network was on an off, people now live online and its bad for business if you are to stay where you are not connected."
"The conference room was well lit, spacious and air con working well and the wifi was super fastThe teas were well prepared and the food (lunch) well cooked and hot and the desert had a wide varietyThe waiters were friendly and accommodative especially the one called Nyasha."
"I Had a great experience, the atmosphere is fresh, greeny environment outside, , the conference rooms are nice and clean, well air conditioned, super fast wifi, no glitches, the food was delicious, the waiters are of great hospitality, good service"
The place was amazing ü§© and brilliant . Would like to stay here again. The stay was excellent to say the least and will definitely consider coming back again . I will come back again in the near future and hopefully this coming month. Thank You
I had a fantastic stay at Cresta Oasis away from the city noise! The outside garden and space is a marvel to look and gives you a refreshing experience as it gives you a relaxing atmosphere that rejuvenate your soul.
"Exceptional Service from the Reception, Rooms ,Food and Customer Service. I enjoyed interacting at the Pool area, the green lawn. Great Function Service and Boardrooms. Great Customer Service and follow up from the Security at the Gate. Awesome Team at Cool Beans Cafe headed by Joseph"
"I went accompanying my husband who was in Harare on business. We brought our toddler (14 months old). We travelled from the UK.Staff are mostly very friendly and attentive.Occasionally a drinks order or something for the room is forgotten- like despite calling ahead, a cot bed took a while to provide; a coffee can take 25 minutes to be made even when the lobby bar isn‚Äôt busy; the wrong drink given- an iced drink rather than hot, wrong cocktail given. This happened several times. When we arrived very very tired with an upset toddler it took far too long to have food served and have a bed made ready for the toddler.The hotel is clean. Housekeeping are great and the room cleaning and fresh linen etc. is faultless.Breakfast is fine. The lunchtime options and evening meals could be significantly improved. The pizza is terrible, the pasta dishes are poor.The high chair provided for my daughter to sit in to eat was filthy, mouldy and had no functional security straps- they were there but broken and stained. If you ask for something extra like a candle to keep flies away it takes too long to be provided.The pool could be cleaner.Of note the following staff were helpful to us:Fidel, Grace, Charles, Rhino, Takura Murairi, Loveson, Melody, Nqobile, Michelle, Lorraine Tanyowa, Priscilla, Regina, Tawanda.Overall we had a good stay, and found other places to have lunch and dinner.We would definitely come again.Thank you."
"One of the worst treatments i have received in my lifetime as a seasoned Traveller. Having booked an executive suit and paid for it in December 2023, only to be told upon my check in that my room is not available. After confrontation was given the room only for them to take it back and give to someone who booked only 2 weeks back. The explanation which i never believed was that the person was from the office of the president. Well, if rooms are reserved for special people let us know prior to booking rather than embarrassing us in front of our spouses for that matter. There were several rooms mix up as i finally decided to take a standard room only to be given a key to a room with someone inside. This is the worst ever!!!!!!!!!"
Cool beans services are amazing. Great services from Crosby. The gardens and swimming pool are all in great condition. The service is always spot on and the staff very friendly. This is my second home when I want to have relax with family or have business meetings. I would recommend anyone to use their facilities
"I attended the H.A.Z Conference in Miti Room and all the services were superb.The meals were so great, and the staff helpful and friendly.We even had an online presenter that connected from another country and it was smooth on the big screen.Would really keep coming here for business conferences and recommend others"
"What an amazing experience from Cresta Lodge. As a first time visitor I was amazed by the beauty of this place from the reception area that's welcoming and clean.2. The friendly staff that helps us carry bags to our rooms and lovely service at the coffee shop that sells very tasty and yummy food and a very good coffee.3. Rooms are very clean and neat. Bottled water daily is a huge tick plus the aircon came handy.4. Lovely food served at the Charter restaurant, no need to go out from breakfast to lunch and amazing dinner.5. Very good location, not far from the airport and the nearest mall Highlands Park.Overall I would definitely recommend Cresta Lodge it's ths best and would definitely book here againm"

"We had a lovely dinner experience at Cresta Lodge on the 14th of February 2024. The service was 5 star and the waiters were very friendly. We loved the romantic atmosphere that was there and it made our first Valentine experience as a married couple so special. Thanks to the manager on duty, we got a lovely bouquet üíê."
"Tinashe the host was amazing for the Valentine's Day dinner. Will definitely come back next time for more of this amazing dining experience. The music was wonderful, the food was on point and well seasoned. A truly wonderful Valentine's Day Dinner experience"
"Not being able to get food and eat while resting ....However got a wonderful service from 3 outstanding personel namely Loveson, Tinashe and Mollyn. Meal dishes were also outstanding with the varieties offered on The buffet............"
"During my trip to Harare, I stayed at Cresta Lodge. The hotel's service was amazing, and the rooms were clean and comfy. The staff was friendly and helpful. It's in a great location too, close to attractions and the Emirates Airlines Office. I highly recommend it."
"The overall visit was spectacular and I highly recommend. Room service was on point, any request made was promptly attended to. The food was scrumptious and top notch. Please do consider Cesta Hotels for your trips and weekend getaways."
"The food and service was great. Service from the waiter ‚ÄúConcillia‚Äù was great and swift. However, TVs need to be changed, the quality is low. Also provide blankets at all times in case of cold weather. Service at the reception was also great too."
"We stayed here in January. Wonderful and very helpful staff, a beautiful location with all the experience that Africa has to offer. A must visit location for your travel! The business facilities were excellent for our group."
"Not a single complaint, very clean hotel and restaurant. All of the staff I was in contact with from receptionist, housekeeper, waiters, door men and security guards at the gate where/are so professional and welcoming. They all go the extra mile to help.Food was on point every time!! Plenty of options. Hats of to the chef!! I loved the scones and muffins during breakfast. I recommend seating by the fountain when having your breakfast.The pool and gardens are clean at all times and well maintained. Perfect for relaxing.I will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend."
Lovely ambienceFriendly staff (Loveson)Delightful meals (sadza with beef mice cupcakes apple tarts debonshire ice cream)Vibrant cocktails (malawi shanty blue lagoon)Comfortable stay (nice bed and balcony) in manyNice poolsidePleasant Zimbabwean weather
"Mallolny is an amazing person,he helped us in every single way and the service had to be the best thing I have experienced in Harare,He is a very kind kind being and caterd for us a lot ,I tried to add a tip for him because what an amazing gentleman he was,he offered us the private room and gave us amazing food.5 stars"
Very relaxing environment. Well treed with early morning songs from birds. A good gym with modern equipment . Helpful and friendly staff. There are places available to hold meetings. Plenty of secure parking space. A very nice coffee shop.
I started at this hotel a part of a wedding event. The location is convenient to the airport and many local venues. My room was beautiful and the hotel had beautiful amenities. The food was delicious and it was great to have onsite food available all day. The staff throughout the hotel was wonderful. I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.
"Cresta Lodge Harare is perfectly situated just outside the buzz of the city centre and has the best hospitality. The rooms are spot on, fresh, clean and comfortable with a nice pool area outside. The staff is very friendly and helpful and they made our stay worthwhile."
"Great food, lots of different vegetables, well cooked and well presented, yummy meats. enjoyed the food!!Lovely clean room, great reception area. The staff could do with some friendliness, smiling and greeting of guests though. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay"
"The customer service from Nyasha Machiwana was top class. She was so polite, expedient and had amazing attention to detail. It has been a refreshing conference.I highly recommend anyone who is having a business meeting or conference to go use Cresta, it has by far surpassed a large number of places in Harare"
"The conference venue has a comprehensive offering of all conferencing needs. The rooms are comfortable and perfect for large meetings. The food was fresh and well prepared. It is close to town.!?$6::?&&!(;,?&&?;)$$;:))7(:()$7;()8)?;:://;"
"Spacious rooms and good breakfast options. Bathroom modern and clean.Very friendly staff, from the reception all the way to the security guard.We arrived late but frontline staff were available. Nyasha, Rumbidza and Rhino were very exceptional.Will definitely come back"
"Great hospitality service from Cresta Lodge Team..Everything was well presented the food was tasty and delicious,the service was over and above.The duty manager Pride came to engage with us and made sure that we were well taken care of.In Harare you are on top in terms of hotel standards and the food standard up top notch.We honestly think Pride deserves an award of worker of the because of how he addressed our issue.He has a great smile which we found to be expectional in the hospitality business, when it comes to service excellence we would rate him 10/10 cause of how he managed to meet the expectations of a customer. Service exellence is measured by the quality of service being offered and we honestly think you are carrying the stick of exellency.Friendly environment and cleanest hotel, Overral impression of the hotel would be 11/10 everything is well organized.We would definately come back and also spread the word to our friends to come and enjoy the great hospitality service at Cresta Lodge Harare....Great team with great management the future should be bright with the youngsters."
"The conference facilities were excellent. Accommodation for people with physical disabilities was disappointing. While the standard is what they called ""paraplegic room"", the main issue was failure to provide a bedside lamp. One needed to go to the door to switch the room lights on and off, or go to the desk to use the desk lamp. The desk lamp could not be moved to the bedside. A request for a bedside lamp was made to no avail.Despite that setback, the room was clean."
Very convenient and excellent conferencing and training facilities. The banqueting staff is very helpful. I particularly like the venue because of its proximity to me workplace. Traffic and parking is also very good.
"Had an amazing amazing stay at Cresta Lodge!! Everything about it is just perfect, especially the food!!! The staff are so helpful and welcoming, special mention to Talent from Reservations , he made sure we are all set and had no complications settling in. Will definitely go back!!"
"Cresta Msasa is the place for people who prefer nature`s serenity yet need to be near the city. The hotel is roughly a few minutes drive from Harare CBD, and is one of the garden hotels that I would happily recommend"
"I had a wonderful experience, attended a business dinner and the service was very good. The team was professional and pleasant. Waiters and waitresses served with grace and speed. The food was delicious, venue was well set up. The coordination was just excellent. Keep it up."
"It was my first time to stay at Cresta Lodge. I have to say the location gives a peace of mind. Cool beans was a perfect spot for me to do my business.The food was excellent, and the service was great, too.This is my new home when I visit Harare."
From the receptionists to the conference room staff everyone was attentive and professional. Special thanks to Maloney who went above and beyond when he made a delicious waffle out of the mess I made of the waffle iron. Bed was comfortable and the food was very good indeed.
"We had an evening function at Cresta Lodge Masasa and Pride Kanunkha helped us from the day of the enquiry to the night of the function. Pride Kanunkha was very professional, responsive , supportive and he was dedicated to his job. Pride also ensured that everything was provided as specified and he went an extra mile to accommodate us and made sure our day was a memorable one and we are grateful for that .Staff at the hotel on the night of the function were very helpful, professional and cheerful .Food was top notch , we can‚Äôt fault anything .Welldone Pride and team. We will defiantly call again ."
"I wanted to treat some very special people in my life to an exclusive dinner experience! I approached Cresta Msasa to enquire about their fine dining option and when their A La Carte dinner options weren‚Äôt quite what I envisioned, Fidelis asked me what I needed and gave me absolute Royal treatment! The chef created an eight course dinner ‚Äòespecially‚Äô for me and my guests and that tasting menu was flavour explosion after flavour explosion! The staff, the decor the ambience! I would 12/10 recommend! Don‚Äôt be shy with special requests! Cresta Msasa will exceed all expectations ü§åüèæüëèüèæ"
Cresta Lodge offers a comfortable environment with a country feel in the city. The grounds around the hotel are magnificent.The restaurant offers a good evening meal and a decent breakfast.Overall I found my stay to be quite pleasant with a room that covers the expected requirements.

What a beautiful place to be with rooms up to par. The yard is well maintained, and cleanliness is up to standard.The rooms are neat, the housekeeping is top notch. Well done, keep up the good work."

"I stayed at the Cresta Lodge , Harare for a week in June 2023. i was on a business trip. I have had previous stays at the same hotel and I continue to be impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, the ambience and the greenery it displays. Futhermore, the team is phenomenal. The reception team is welcoming, the entire hotel staff are always smiling and courteous. The confernce rooms were spacious and warm given the chilly winter upon us. The cleanliness of the hotel grounds and  rooms is worth mentioning. There were no interuptions of power throughout our stay. The food was lovely and they had an onsite gym to shed off the excess calories. I highly recommend the hotel for those seeking a quite , paeceful yet vibrant atomsphere. Well done team Cresta Lodge!"
"The location, friendliness of staff and breakfast offerings are definitely the highlight of this hotel.The Green Bean cafe is somewhat disappointing, as well as the shower pressure and water temperature in the rooms.All in all a pleasant stay and due to its convenient location we would probably stay again and opt to eat at Chatters Restaurant and not the Cafe."
"Make sure you improve your electronic door system,you need also to have Bank ATMs for easy cash access.The transport system from the airport and local movements charges has to be clearly stated before the visit.The arrangement of charging conference room , food  and snacks was so confusing, as guest were made to sign several documents every day."
We arrived in Harare late at night and phoned cresta. They happily accommodated us and their price was extremely reasonable. The rooms were clean and modern with a small fridge and a coffee station. Their buffet breakfast had a huge variety of delicious foods. We would stay there again without hesitation.
"Reservation charged my credit card with 3 rooms, for me and my 2 colleges, and was not able to redeem me to the credit card. Instead they requested me to supply bank account number to redeem. The way to do it is to book the funds to secure availability, Not charge the money!The door key system: When my key did not work, the advise was to dial 9 from the corridor phone.I followed advice and was left 25 minutes waiting in the corridor until I access my room!Next day the lock system had been changed without notifying me. This time I walked straight to reception to get my key card changed....Not able to charge a drink at the pool bar to my room. ""You don't have any extras for your room. You have to put a deposit in reception to charge anything to your room""  You have my credit card details...‚Ä¶! Seems like reservations and reception is 2 different company's?All in all, this is not acceptable for me. If you are a experienced international traveler, I would not recommend this hotel....you will be disappointed."
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Responsive staff and beautiful garden. Quiet room with Aircon. The pool area is well maintained. The breakfast was extensive and delicious . Would recommend the hotel for people traveling from outside
"Staff was attentive, friendly and courteous.  Would highly recommend to stay. I would highly recommend this place for anyone travelling this way. Beautiful courtyard with pool and some of the rooms are equipped with balconies."
"The rooms are nice and clean for sure. It's a beautiful premises with beautiful serene sounds in the heart of Harare. However, the customer service by the staff could be better. From the front desk reception to the concierge service. And the restaurant staff could do better - the supervisors are walking around in suits and completely oblivious of the customers they are serving. Or is it maybe the assumption is that paying customers look a certain way, and the rest of us look like we just rolled in from the streets. Anyway, they could do better."
"High tea snacks did not meet our expectations. Very disappointing. Special dietary requirements were not provided for as indicated via email.Dinner and breakfast were quit good, no gluten free options for breakfast"
"The hotel is good. Located in a quiet and relaxing environment with good gardens. Not very far from the city centre and from the airport, yet so quiet and relaxing. Good connecting and competent staff. I also got a shuttle at a very fair price."
Dear Worthy Chinhamo   Thank you for taking time to review us. Glad to know we met your expectations. We hope to see you again soon.
Dear Pfinayi  Thank you for the review. We aim to provide nothing but the best. Looking forward to hosting you again.
Thank you for taking time to review us. We value your comments and hope to see you again soon!
Great service. I had a wonderful one week stay and I can highly recommend Cresta Lodge to any other guests in the near future. From the drivers to receptionists and chef great people. Highly recommended.
The hotel provides excellent service and good customer care. They have friendly and responsive staff. The facilities are located within a lovely setting and environment away from the hustle and bustle of town.
"My stay was incredibly great... Hadn't slept out in a while and my stay at Cresta was worth the while, the service, the food was amazing.the staff too gave us first class service... I'm was impressed and highly recommend anyone to go experience such great service"
"Clean and relaxing hotel. Staff very polite and cheerful. Would highly recommend and come back again when in Zimbabwe.Booked 2 double  Rooms , they were both Modern,clean and spacious . Ordered room service which was delivered even though it had a tray charge of $5 it was worth the service as staff were cheerful and polite and very willing to help. Breakfast had plenty of options at $28 pp. Grounds are well maintained and there is a car wash service available and $15"
"Last month, I hosted a delegation of South Asian at Cresta Lodge for one week of meetings.  I‚Äôve organized similar programs in hundreds of hotels around the world, and I‚Äôd have to say that the staff of Cresta Lodge was perhaps the most caring I‚Äôve ever seen.  From the front desk to the back office/reservations to the restaurant and even the bar ‚Äì everyone is responsive and genuinely wants to help you and does so with a smile.  I‚Äôd like to give some specific shout-outs ‚Äì Leslie in group reservations, Liberty Chinyanga, and Grace at the front desk ‚Äì each of them went above and beyond for me and my delegation.  There were many others, but unfortunately, I failed to note their names for this review.  In addition to the kudos to the staff, I‚Äôd like to say I loved the beautiful outdoor setting of the restaurant and the garden surroundings of the hotel.  So relaxing!My only complaint is the responsiveness from the accounting office on providing me a draft of my invoice for review.  At the time of departure, there were still many errors that took the next couple of weeks to fix.  With very large and complex bookings such as mine, there are bound to be mistakes, but I wish the hotel had taken me seriously when I asked to have it prepared 2 days in advance of my check out.  But in the end (after a couple of weeks), it all got worked out."
"An amazing experience at cresta,the 2 day stay was worth it, the environment provided the perfect opportunity for us a s a company to do our strategic meeting.Both the indoor and outdoor facilities are top notch,coupled with excellent service from the staff"
"the stay was so refreshing and peaceful. the facilities are the market current standards and the staff is friendly and welcoming. the food is fresh and always warm. the signage at the gate is not visible enough at night though, so you should really be on the lookout."
We came for a wedding and everything was just on point and the setup was amaizing.Tsho and Pride hosted us very well and the service waiters were excellent.Great service from this team!!!The food was mouth-watering ‚ù§Ô∏èand i enjoyed the food more than anything.I recomend Cresta Lodge for wedding venues the environment is friendly.
"The grounds were beautiful especially the inside decor. Every person was truly welcoming, helpful & willing to provide assistance. The beds were very comfortable especially after a long day. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
"We did not stay at the Lodge but instead had a wonderful unrushed experience during what could potentially have been a very overcrowded lunchtime. The Cresta welcome party was efficient, and Andy was responsible for our table of 18 guests, offering service with a smile. He was very accommodating, even for those who wanted afternoon tea on top of the various beverages on offer!  It did become crowded around the harvest tables at some point. We were however spoilt for choice with the buffet of starches, meats and vegetables at two serving points. The mouth-watering desserts were the cherry on the cake!Two of our family members then won two raffle prizes, which was an unexpected Christmas treat.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and a fish dish in addition to the creamy mushroom pasta would have been welcome for the vegetarians."
