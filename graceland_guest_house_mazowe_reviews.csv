Not good for regular tea/coffee drinkers as rooms do not have such facility. Television was down and poor ventilation in the room I slept in.,2023-11-07

The staff is really helpful very happy to assist very very punctual with dinner it was on the dot I was very impressed The food tasted really good The chef did a good job honestly. I wouldn't complain about the room because it was very comfortable laying on the bed The bed was a good mattress and also they have a drink machine and options to buy drinks as well The dinner is affordable and The gardens accommodate you to rest and relax and sit down they even have a swing at the back which is lovely I didn't get to have a go this time but I will next time.,2022-10-09

"There is lack of supervision on the cleaners.  Sometimes bins were not emptied and if you tell the receptionist, they will look surprised and still will do nothing to rectify the situation until the next day. One of the receptionist had an attitude towards residents. They should put more photos showing the roo for someone booking online  not only showing the bed. They need to fumigate as they were a lot of spiders and spider webs which were not cleaned.  Overally, a good place only if they get a supervisor to double check work done",2022-01-22
