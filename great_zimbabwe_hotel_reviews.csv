reviews

"Very punctual The ladies in the restaurant are superb, always willing to assist and with a smile..."
Meal prices were much higher than anticipated for breakfast and dinner buffets
Lovely location
The room was spacious and clean
"Stayed here one night to not be in a rush while seeing the ruins. Delightful property that is clean, safe and surrounded by various animals at night (monkeys, baboons, etc). Food quality was good at the restaurant but buffet dinner starts too late - tourists don't care to wait until 19:00 to eat, they are up early to do tours and want to eat when they come back and move on with the evening."
Loved the swimming pool. The food was okay but not great. Power outage was a disappointment but I realize there was nothing to be done.
Very African Standard. Quite diffent between their broucher and the real guest room.
"Didn't like anything about this property. I was very badly treated, given an awful room which was no where near the standard i would have expected for the price I paid. I did eventually get another room, which was better but still not great, noisy, cold shower, very dated, broken chair and three bathroom wasn't that clean. Food was also of a poor quality"
"We chose this hotel for its nearness to the great Zimbabwean Ruins. It is a pleasant 700 metres walk. Our room was large, room and bathroom in need of upgrading. The bed large and comfortable. The staff without exception were friendly, helpful and efficient. The buffet breakfast, which was included was great. There are no aircons only a fan. Feel that this Hotel is over priced."
"Though the setting is stunning and the staff is sweet the hotel is completely overpriced for the current state it is in. As with many of Zim hotels it has not had any renovations or upgrading done in decades. The bathroom was the worst, hardly a working shower and the tab of the basin did not give water. Loose tiles, dirty walls, chips and cracks everywhere. The setting is great, next to the stunning Great Zimbabwe monument."
"Service was great, even the trainees did a nice job. Large room with a large bed, not so comfortable shower and bathroom. The food in the restaurant was not particularly good. All in all I'd say you stay at this place for the location, since you can walk to the Great Zimbabwe Ruins. Other than that, it's totally overpriced for the quality it offers, and that goes for both the room and the food."
Best location to visit Great Zimbabwe
"lovely hotel in the middle of nowhere! was a bit difficult to locate but once we found it, I was glad I had booked it. its also unbelievably close to the great zimbabwe ruins, which worked out perfectly staff are very nice as well."
"In general it was great. The staff are welcoming and helpful. The location couldn't be bettered. The hotel is a bit distressed, but attempts have been made to improve things. There was plenty of hot water and the beds were very comfortable with good linen. The few glitches are not worth mentioning; this is Zimbabwe after all. The main problem was that the card machine was not working and we had to use up all our cash. That left us with nothing to tip the staff, which was a shame as they deserved it."
"My last visit to this hotel was in 1997. Some parts have been renovated. It was a pity, that the door facing to the swimming pool couldn't be opened due to defective door lock. Missed the peacocks, which were there earlier and also the palm tree with the weaver bird nests. It was an attraction at that time. Food and staff very good. I find the hotel overpriced. Need some adaptation. Anyway, might be back in a while."
"You know ... how Zimbabwe works. Very Good will. No energy, no loght ...."
Slechte ontvangst. Vrij basic kamer met deur naar naastgelegen kamer en dus erg gehorig. Restaurant vrij slecht
"Ein gutes Hotel für einen besuch in Great Zimbabwe, es liegt nahe dem Great Zimbabwe Park. Das Hotel ist so, wie alle Hotels, die ich in Zimbabwe erlebt habe: sehr sauber, sehr freundliche Leute, gute Ausstattung, eventuell ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen. Unser Zimmer war eines von vielen kleinen aneinandergereihten Bungalows. Die Bungalows hatten eine gemeinsame Terrasse und einen großen Garten, bei dem man einen wunderschönen afrikanischen Sonnenuntergang sehen kann. Das Essen im Hotel war gute normale internationale Küche."
"Dyrt, men fint hotell. Gangavstand til ruinene i Great Zimbabwe. Kjempefrokost og god service. God mat på restauranten. Meget romslig rom. Vennlig og serviceminded betjening."
Wunderbare Lage nur wenige Gehminuten von Great Zimbabe entfernt. Das superfreundliche Personal ist äußerst hilfsbereit und macht den Aufenthalt in der sehr auberen und ansprechenden Lodge mehr als angenehm.
Ottima posizione per poter visitare Great Zimbabwe ruins per chi non fa self drive. Sia i servizi che la qualità degli stessi sono abbastanza buoni. Carinissimo svegliarsi la mattina e trovarsi circondati dai babbuini...bella esperienza!
总体不错，环境、卫生、特别是观看景点方便。但是要严防猴子！
"Gutes Mittelklass-Hotel in unmittelbarer Umgebung von ""Great Zimbabwe"" auf einer Anhöhe in mitten einer schönen Parkanlage gelegen. Unser Zimmer war sauber und in Ordnung. Die Möblierung war zweckmässig aber eher alt und abgegriffen. Badezimmer war zweckdienlich, sauber und mit funktionierender Wasserversorgung. Der Kühlschrank im Zimmer war leider parktisch nicht kühlend. Der Room Service war in Ordnung aber auch nicht mehr. Das Abendessen im Restaurant des Hotels war verhältnismässig gut mit aufmerksamem Bediendpersonal. Allerdings wurde auf unsere Hinweise und teilweien Sonderwünsche nur zögerlich oder gar nicht eingetreten. Alles in allem ein ruhiger unspektakulärer Ort um ein, zwei Nächte im Zusammenhang mit dem Besuch von Great Zimbabwe zu verbringen. Für Langzeitaufenthalt eher nicht empfehlenswert."
立地が最大のメリットなので（とは言っても遺跡に隣接というほど近くはありませんが）、他に多くは求めません。部屋はやや古びた感はあるものの普通に快適でネットも無料で使え、プールやテニスコートもあります。やや割高感はありますが、これはジンバブエ国内のホテルではどこも共通したところなので現地事情を踏まえればまあ普通といった感じでしょうか。 スタッフはみな親切でしたし、自分のうっかりで生じたトラブルについても適切に対応してくれました。雨が降った後で館内の電気がしばしば瞬断したり、レストランのメニューに実際は作れないものが結構あったりというのもありましたが、これはまあご愛嬌ということで。甘いかな。
