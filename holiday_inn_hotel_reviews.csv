review
"I stopped over from Victoria falls since I had a day to explore Harare before flying out. I called the hotel regarding my reservation and Pamela from the front desk was quite helpful in accepting my request based on the slight complication I had. After a long journey, I arrived earlier than the standard check in time, however Victoria was kind enough to ensure I received my spacious & clean room as soon as possible. Thanks to Angela from housekeeping too for the clean room."
"This hotel was fine, rooms were nice, staff was really friendly and helpful. Also, the food was outstanding. Did not expect that at a Holiday Inn. Kudos to the chef and the kitchen staff!  Would recommend if you need a place to stay in Harare for layover."

The rooms still have that old kind of window AC, which makes a lots of noice. The taps in the bathrooms were leaking. Toilet flush was not working. There was no toilet papers or tissues, safe box was broken. I checked in and requested a room change and they denied. I have paid fully so I didn't had option to check out and go somewhere else. Very poor room.Room Service takes thier nown sweet time in delivering even some glasses or ice cubes. Once you place the order they will argue with you about payment. Come on I am your resident guest and I would like to get the bill added to room. What's the issue?Thier brekfast set-up was good with good variety. I liked it. Swimming pool area was good. I was not able to use it as water was very cold. The bar is also nice with a smiling and every Happy to help bartender.Over all, I hated staying here. Come one IHG what's wrong with you? We stay with you because of your high standards. This hotel is way too expensive and services were zero. You used to give a special notes to our kind of regulars . Now there is nothing... I would avoid it next time."
"Check in left out plenty of information that was necessary for a comfortable stay, so I called/went back n forth to reception for this reason. For eg. having made a reservation via the IHG app, I went up to the room and later as I ordered room service I was told that front desk would require my credit card details… I called, went down etc. Inform guests of all necessaries before shooting them off to the room, cold front.Room: Basic, non frilly type which is fine as I was not on holiday. Loved the large inch tv screen that had so many channels (comparably). The bathroom is so dated. Awful, most awful I have seen in a long, long time. Food: Only had room service, which provided delightfully fresh food, on time. Great service from that end. Shuttle service was on time, all the time. I think also reservation desk must explain that payment is to the provider, which was both a problem because from experience I had small cash for incidentals. Or can one include this payment along with other hotel expenses??And then the neighbourhood music that went well into the next morning both Friday and Saturday was awful, but I realised that cannot be worked around because of where  the hotel is located. Pro is its within walking distance of the city centre."
"The rooms are clean, and the top floor view of the city was amazing. The internet is also excellent. The meals are of a wide variety. The staff was friendly, excellent and accommodating to our business needs."
"I received the best reception on my wedding night, i was tired but the environment changed everything. The breakfast was very good, friendly staff there is. I would recommend brides to choose this place for the wedding night."
"What a disappointment.  I reallt enjoyed my February stay.  But this time round, everything was so-so, the friendliness of staff somewhat forced, the food ranged from mediocre to send-it-back.  The airport shuttle didnt pitch and I am still waiting for the promised hairdryer to arrive."
"So disappointed.Checked in to this hotel, received my room key and when I went to the room  with my wife to open the door I but upon a half naked lady in the room, just as confused as I was.The staff member seems so clueless as to why the rooms were double booked and could not give me any clear reason.Up to this point, no duty manager has even reached out to me to apologise or try to be proactive about the situation.Piss poor and as an IHG reward member I am sorely disappointed."
"When my employer asked me to come and do work here in Harare, I asked to be placed in a nice hotel, suited for business trips. They recommended the Holiday Inn Harare. I checked out the website and I was happy, it looked good, clean, close to shops etc. I am not a complainer in nature, but I feel I have to bring this to the attention of management and other people looking to stay here.First, the good things:1.	Nice TV2.	Nice firm bed3.	Overall it is clean.4.	The air-conditioning is good5.	The bedding is clean.6.	I asked for a blanket and within minutes a warm nice soft blanket was delivered.Firstly, the photos on the internet and the reality are not the same. The hotel has a cold atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful, but you really should do something to make it more welcoming. The hotel room itself is nice and specious, but really cold and in need of updating. For USD90 a night, b&b, one it not expected to find this and the following issues below. I just came from Mozambique, where I stayed in the Radisson Blu Maputo and Zambia Lusaka where I stayed in the Pamodzi hotel. For the same price these two hotels are very much higher-market, updated and value for money, extremely friendly and welcoming staff and just 2 great places overall.•	The toilet area is dark, the bath/shower feels yucky and small. Please consider getting better lighting in the bathroom.•	The taps really need replacement.  •	The towels feel like they came out of the 80’s. •	There are not enough hangers in the closet•	The closet door doesn’t slide open, you must lift and push it. Then it sounds like you are breaking down the door.•	There is no plug where the kettle is – you must move the kettle around.•	The coffee is cheap, and there was the coffee creamer was not replaced on Tuesday.•	There are not enough drawers for longer staying guests. •	The hairdryer is poor. The hairdryer cord is short and once you find a plug for it, you cannot get to a mirror.•	The window barely opens, you also must lift and push with might to get it open.•	As stated, the staff is friendly and helpful, but one gets the feeling they do not want to be disturbed or go out of their way.•	I feel sorry for the waitering staff at the breakfast, they run around trying their best, but:•	The breakfast buffet has been the same each day – I will not recommend anyone to take the breakfast option – food is bland in uninteresting. •	Covid is still with us yes, but really – we are adults, we can dish up for ourselves. Why do we need to be dished up for like children?•	Also, there are not enough tables in the restaurant during breakfast. I had to run around for a spot, just to return with a plate of food, and my spot was taken up by another guest (no offence to the other guest)•	I paid upfront for the 2 weeks stay. Last night my colleagues and I went down to the bar for drinks. I asked them to put it on my hotel room tab. They came back saying they don’t have my credit card details on system, so I have to settle my account before I leave the bar. Really – Am I going to run away during the night without checking out? We are professional people. I have never ever in all my travel had to be treated like that – it was embarrassing. •	Again with the COVID for some reason, there is no room service menu. Due to COVID, they stopped the service...Really – the last thing I want to do is run around for dinner after a long day at the office. The room service person said he can arrange for room service, but will have to read the menu to me of what is available. No thank you.•	There are two shelves where I assume TV’s were mounted to…the TVs are not mounted to the wall – why not remove them and hang a picture? It really is a cold place.•	The gap in the wall for the safe is too big. It just looks unneat. Some of us are spending a week, 2 weeks here, we want to look at nice things. It is depressing.•	One of the bedside lamp’s globe flickered, so I unscrew it – do random checks to see if the items still work.•	The standing lamp’s head/shade really is leaning to the side – tighten it or replace it. It really also looks like it had enough of this sadness.•	Also, my colleague checked out today – he has not had hot water since he stayed here – he requested more than once that it be checked into, but no help or change in the situation. That is not nice. He moved to another hotel for the duration of our stay.The hotel serves it’s purpose. It is not the Holiday Inns I remember from when, as a child, we spend our holidays in. It is not a friendly, welcoming hotel. For USD90 p/n, I am sure that it can be better. Please see this as possible feedback, I know you can do better. Currently it feels more like a hostel than a nice hotel, a home away from home. Make your foreign guests, who are alone in your country, a foreign country, feel more at home, welcomed and appreciated. Please.With all due respect. Again, the staff only do what they can. Treat them well too please.."
Stayed at the Holiday Inn for 3 nights. When we checked in the lady at reception did not record our payment. When we were checking out the hotel requested that we pay again only to realize that their staff had made a mistake. For an IHG member their service is appalling. The room service is slow and some of the hotel amenities need upgrading. Would not recommend it for anyone travelling to Harare.

"We stayed 2 nights in Harare at the HI, and the service and friendliness of the staff were top notch!Their rooms haven’t quite had the rebranding like the ones in the states, but the rooms were clean and the beds were nice.  Breakfast buffet was a bit speedy for the selection offered, but again, great and friendly service!Thanks for a great stay!"
Centrally Located Nice Hotel in HarareRooms are OK but Washrooms Need RepairsBreakfast is very Good and Restaurant is FineStaff is good and living up to HIG StandardsPrice is Very High and not Value for Money Paid
"My stay was quite comfortable.  The hotel has a nice menu (albeit and expensive one) that includes food more intended for European and American tastes.  The stay was pricier than staying at a lodge, but there is an extra level of security here than they tend to offer.  They have a pool and a workout room.  They have EXCELLENT staff who seem to exist for the purpose of Nanking your stay comfortable.  They are also across the street from a food court that offers inexpensive options (including beg) as well as just down that same street from a Nando’s.The biggest downside was that during a Saturday night stay there was such a loud noise from the club (either next door or part of the same complex...I wasn’t quite sure) all night that sleep was difficult.  The other nights it wasn’t a problem.When I checked in the rooms at the level I had paid for were all occupied so they upgraded me to the suite, which was extremely nice!"
I spent a few days at this hotel on a business trip to Harare.Advantages:Very well located close to downtown Very cleanFriendly and professional staffDisadvantages The hotel’s lobby is so small that you can barely find a spot to sit outside your roomThe café at the swimming pool closes early They are still working on their gym; I hope it will open soonThe internet connection is average The rooms surely need to be modernized especially the bathrooms
"I have to finalise my review as I was travelling to Harare PHD Church for prayers with Prophet Magaya. After spending a night in Moatize Tete Mozambique I finally reached Harare on 28th February. On 1st March a friend took me out for a walk within Harare City and we had nice time at Holiday Inn. The structure of the building matches with the food served. I enjoyed the refreshments and snacks and by the time I went to my main destination which is PHD, I had appreciated the hospitalilty of Holiday Inn.  In Malawi we say Nsima and in Zimbabwe the same is called Sadza, well it was also a good experience to teste Sadza 💋👄"
"We enjoyed the rooms,service was one among equals,food was excellent.The foyer and pool added a lot of restful environment.The General manager and his staff make you feel at home.I would love to go back again to experience the Royal service i got."
"The property is a bit different than other Holiday Inn properties. The rooms are spacious, but needs maintenance. There were not much options on the Room Service Menu. The breakfast spread was good. Need to improve on the food options."
"We were based in the holiday inn for a week and had a really enjoyable visit. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate all our requests, including available taxis, quick service, friendly nature and many other things. They learnt our names, returned my phone when I accidentally forgot it in the car and so on... it was wonderful. The food served at the restaurant was good quality and plentiful at breakfast time. The rooms were clean and spacious. The wifi was strong throughout. Only small comment for improvement was the lack of a gym (which my colleagues wanted to use) and so the hotel staff had to shuttle people to another place which wasn't that convenient for them."
Last Thursday week had the opportunity  to pop into the Harare Holiday Inn for a light  snack went  out to the pool area. Very pleasant though it  did take a while for service .Having said that when the waiter did eventually arrive  it  was all smiles and very accommodating. I ordered a toasted chiken  and mayo sandwich and a Guava fruit juice  with lots  of  ice. These arrived timorously  and  had a glass full of  ice to  add to the  juice as I wanted. Cost wise  for  locals I found  a  expensive. USD rate was fare but the main  problem  is  change  which  was an  issue.
It was great to visit Holiday Inn last Christmas as I had worked there back in 2011! It’s great to see that the standards are still quite high considering the economic situation. They had a great tradition Christmas spread with a braai at the end by the poolside! It was worth every buck and more! The service was attentive and the music was appropriate I supppse for the small space (two man band). The pool was sparkling clean and fun for the kids in the December heat. One suggestion though it would be easier on our bellies if the braai started a bit later after lunch. We found ourselves gobbling down the lovely pudding and rushing to get some braiied meat before they closed down. Overall thumbs up!
I visited others here twice to dine with them but didn't stay in the hotel. The restaurant offers friendly service and decent food at a reasonable price. Decor is simple and without frills and the food was tasty and straightforward.
"Great service, great staff. Clean room and prompt room service. The bathrooms are clean and well maintained. Great views on the west side. The bed is so comfortable I almost overslept haha. Not as good as Holiday Inn Bulawayo but thats acceptable"
"I stayed elsewhere but went to the Holiday Inn for drinks.  It was a nice little bar.  Not hopping, more of an ""after business drink"" type of place.  Despite being part of a $120/ night hotel the drinks were reasonably priced."
I was on transit to Bulawayo the hotel has great beds Sleep quality perfectThey still have bath tubs not showers very uncomfortable to use especially for older people They offer transfer to /from airport bitbi found it expensive at $50 round trip Staff service excellent
I just pass through to wins down and have a fruit juice by the pool side.Its a cool sport in town i must add.Service delivery can be improved however but overally the hotel is smart and well managed.
"one of the best hotels in harare, good accommodation, close to 24/7 shops and few minutes away from fast food take away / sit in, a walk away from city centre, parking available and feels safe and secure, has the best breakfast one can ever ask for in harare"
"Good check in. Rooms are not as bad as expected. Clean, though basic. Nice seating area at the pool. Good breakfast. Not included in Corp rate but for 15 USD affordable. Ok to come back. Professional and friendly staff."
"Very friendly personal, good food, clean rooms and what is important, always warm water available. Frendly and professional personal, good restaurant, nice swimmingpool, not far from the city of town."
Want to be in town Harare ? The place to be is holiday inn. Excellent accommodation and facilities. The staff is friendly and I have enjoyed my each and every stay there. I highly recommend holiday inn.
I was there for one night! The room was ok but had an ac problem! The hotel shuttle was reliable and on time. The hotel food was ok with quite some variety of foods- buffet and a la carte! Good service in the Resto!!
"Our check inn was instant welcoming reservations as well as the checkoutWe really had nice time the rooms excellent very tidy well airconditioned , wifi efficient in the rooms at the main area even at the poolAll the meals were superb nothing to complain prefered buffet services in the Vumba restaurant"
"This has nothing to do with Holiday Inn brand, its the worst hotel, worst food, noisy window a/cTowels and bed sheets are yellow, food and room service serves low quality 0 taste food, tap water is smelly,Electricity keeps going off and on, for any reason you’re travelling: dont stay there.Only one +, staff are friendly and wish they can do anything"
"My experiance of staying was not good , food in restaurant bad choice and expenisive to its quality , location good , staff good , room size OK . not worth to stay again , cost of room more than its worth"
Holiday In Harare is now renovated. The rooms are quite refreshing for the nights sleep and rest. The hotel staff are always welcoming and friendly. The food has a wide variety in the restaurant. The hotel is just waking distance into the Harare CBD.
Spent 4 nights whilst attending a business meeting. Hadn’t been stayed there in a couple of months and found the service still very good. WiFi is also very reliable .The Hotel is in the city & one can walk to the nearest shops or take a taxi.
"We were in Harare and needed a nice place to stay for a couple nights. The Holiday Inn provided that for us. The first night we came in after dark. The staff were very kind and helpful. We were given clean rooms and a quiet stay. The in-house restaurant was very good and reasonable prices. The morning breakfast was great. The staff were more than helpful and willing to go the extra mile, even drumming up raisins for our jungle oats porridge! All in all, a good place to stay in the capital."
"A quick visit to Zimbabwe and I found myself at Holiday Inn Harare.Staff are friendly and helpful but no porter to direct you to your room. These are basics that many hotels in Africa would offer.The room is stuffy with old half working window type AC.The shower had good pressure but the bathrooms is certainly dated which will need to be upgraded if the place is to reclaim its past glory.Breakfast was good and I am great fan of Guavas . I was happy to find them for breakfast on my first day.Wi-Fi is OK while the lobby is quashed , you wonder how did that happen in a old hotel since space was never an issue those days.I will give them another chance and I hope they start refurbishing the rooms."
"The service here was incredible! Everyone was beyond helpful, kind, and accommodating. The room was clean, spacious, and had a very reliable wifi connection. Even the food was amazing! The only drawback is that it doesn't have a gym, but the pool is quite nice. If you're in Harare, this is definitely a good place to stay!"
"Stay there this past week for three nights,the front desk  people are so welcoming with special mention to Marshal,l enjoyed the food which was properly cooked ,your could do better on the beds the one l slept wasn't comfy."
"I was there for one day meeting. The hotel didn't like the pictures I saw on the internet. But hey I was there for work, what mattered was a bed, food and connectivity. The staff members were great especially the restaurant staff. I enjoyed being there since I could work, eat, and touch base with my people at home. It's close to the city centre if you have any business there. I will single out Tafadzwa, Last and Never as the gentlemen who served me with an open heart and diligence."
I just pass through to wins down and have a fruit juice by the pool side.Its a cool sport in town i must add.Service delivery can be improved however but overally the hotel is smart and well managed.
