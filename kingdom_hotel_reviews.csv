Excellent Place.,2023-09-01
"the dining was outdoor with all flies, mosquitoes and other bugs flying in and around the food",2018-07-31
"Comfortable and quiet rooms
Walking distance to major attractions 
Very friendly and accommodating staff",2023-06-14
"Beautiful sprawling property. Very close to Victoria Falls and other activities - easily walkable. 

It's a large complex - meaning we had a 10 min walk to our rooms. However, anytime we requested anything in the room - the service people showed in no time! My son had issue with his foot. The hotel provided wheel chair service. Our porter and wheel chair assistant were very prompt and super helpful.

The hotel has buffet service. Which I felt was a rip off with $35 per person tag. We decided to eat out instead.",2022-03-26
"We loved our stay at the kingdom. The room was perfectly comfortable, the grounds are lovely, the staff was friendly and helpful and the location was close to everything. It may be a bit dated but we found it pleasing all around and would definitely recommend it for a local, Vic falls themed hotel experience.",2014-06-30
Just a phenomenally designed property and the closest hotel to the Victoria Falls national park area (walkable).,2017-08-30
"Need an update. But for what it is, a good value property.",2015-03-01
This is a hidden gem and would highly recommend this property! Staff were all friendly and extremely helpful. Would definitely come back again!,2019-06-03
It was absolutely wonderful. The staff were amazing and couldn’t help you more! Great rooms and price!,2020-11-01
"Only wish I had a room closer to reception (I have bad legs) and that there was a shower only, not on the bath",2022-11-11
They were really kind and allowed me to check in early.,2019-02-11
The food was good as well the ambience. It was close to all amenities. Staff were attentive.,2023-06-13
"The hotel was close to all the attractions. We were able to walk to the Falls and restaurants.
Breakfast buffet was good with lots of choices.
Did not use the pools, I’m sure the water was clean but looked grey.
There was no air conditioning so it was difficult,to sleep at night ....too hot and humid. The fan wasn’t very effective.",2019-11-27
"The hotel was within walking distance of the Falls, but we were encouraged to take a taxi. The staff was somewhat helpful, but not overly so. Very good breakfast.",2018-10-03
"The hotel buildings are unique with great brick work tiles and thatch. Large room with balcony, great pool area and attentive staff. 
Pool bar frequently out of stock of certain items and would  promise what we ordered and then short deliverer.",2021-11-21
This is an old hotel.  Charming.  But it does show some aging.  We had a couple of issues with our room and staff was readily available to deal with them. Staff was great.  Food was excellent.  Terrific pool area.  I'd definitely recommend.,2016-09-20
"A/C was off for 5 hours on our first day there

Otherwise everything was great",2015-10-30
"This Kingdom hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the falls and in the other direction shops, restaurants, and supermarkets, the included breakfast was excellent. Regular power outages were not too much of a problem as the hotel has generators. The Kingdom hotel does accept international credit card for hotel expenses. Take US currency, I was unable to find an ATM that worked to get some local currency and credit cards are not widely accepted at Victoria Falls.",2017-03-19
very close to the falls & breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of food,2022-03-22
Power issues but this was out of the control of resort.  They had backup generators.   Apparently there is an ongoing issue in Zimbabwe with their power grid.   Sad as the people and the activities around Victoria Falls is amazing.   So glad we went even though we knew ahead of time about the power issue.,2022-11-02
"The hotel felt a lot like a tourist trap. Maybe this is to be expected in the location so close to the falls, but after spending several days in Kruger, we were not expecting this. The",2017-09-05

"Great location, beautiful hotel and food was lovely.",2020-05-12
You are limited for choice in Victoria Falls. This place has a Disney like quality but in badly need of some maintenance. The aircon won’t work most of the time due to power restrictions and they don’t have most of the things on their drinks menu. Don’t eat in the restaurant other than for breakfast unless you want experience extreme disappointment. I couldn’t find half of the facilities they said they had.,2022-12-06
"The room was very nice and the staff were exceptionally helpful. Spencer was particularly kind and capable as he wrapped a large wooden giraffe for me to take on the plane. The staff also answer lots of questions and went out of their way to be helpful. The location of the hotel is also excellent as it is within walking distance to the falls.
Breakfast was really very nice but the food from the menu at dinner was mediocre at best. We had three dinners there and did not enjoy a single one of them.",2016-08-22
There's charge to use spa. And they only open 9am to 5 pm.,2017-09-23
"Easy check in and help getting to room. Comfortable bed with mosquito netting.  Dinner buffet at restaurant had a lot of selection but not much to my liking.  Problems with internet created trouble with charging things, but wifi worked good in room.",2019-02-08
"Gracious staff, well appointed furniture, beautiful patio balcony over lagoon and grounds can hear falls, easy walk to falls, wonderful breakfast, excellent shower",2014-11-01
Nice grounds and within walking distance of the falls.,2023-05-10
"Great location for this resort-type hotel, within 10 mins walk of the Falls. Right next door to the famous Victoria Falls Hotel where you can pop in for drinks and meals at the same prices. Breakfast was excellent!  Great value all round and well maintained.",2020-12-23
"Really nice facilities, very close to the falls.
Sometimes it was difficult to get the right info",2023-05-28
"Please be warned: There is a problem booking with EXPEDIA. We booked a family room for one night. On Expedia's site, when you select 2 adults and 2 kids, no rooms show. But when selecting just 2 adults, the option to book a family room (which has 2 beds+2 bunk beds) appears and it also says kids stay free, plus free breakfast. So we booked this. When we arrived at the hotel, they told us that the free breakfast is only for the adults but the kids have to pay an extra US$16 each for breakfast. When we complained (and it doesn't say this on the itinerary), they asked if we booked with Expedia and they said that this is a common problem with Expedia's site. 

In any case, the breakfast was definitely not worth US$32 for the kids so we ended up going to an outside restaurant. Very disappointed at both Expedia and the way the hotel handled this (spoiled our experience). Sort out your booking systems (Expedia), and the hotel needs to learn to provide better service (no wonder they are failing).",2018-12-31
The property needs major refurbishment. The food needs to greatly improve.,2019-07-18
Room a bit too noisy as it’s downstairs overall perfect location hotel,2020-10-01
"The staff were all incredible from the traditional tribal greeting, through checkin and throughout our seven night stay.  We based ourselves here and did several Safari excursions from the hotel.  The only niggle was the pool was freezing cold but to be expected in such a hot country.  We wholly recommend The Kingdom at Victoria Falls!",2021-01-17
EASY ACCESS (WALK) TO FALLS AND BRIDGE. GREAT BREAKFAST. NICE HOTEL.,2014-01-14
Amazing staff and hotel.  Felt very welcome and comfortable.,2023-08-08
Exceptional service great staff food was great. Amazing views and beautiful rooms My kids loved the place . Enjoyed,2019-06-14
"Great location and hospitality, enjoyed the stay and their services",2018-10-04
"This is brilliantly located in terms of proximity to the Falls.  The whole atmosphere is very relaxing, with spacious surroundings.",2022-10-05
"Great location for going to the falls, this is the only hotel on our southern Africa trip that offered multiple shapes of electric outlets, excellent breakfast.  Expensive.",2018-10-31
The entertainment was great and the grounds were beautiful.,2018-01-11
"The staff was wonderful in every way. The rooms are a bit out dated in terms of furnishings. Overall they need remodeling. However, the staff definitely makes up for it!!!",2015-09-26
I loved that it was so close to the falls.  It was close also to the old Victoria falls hotel where high tea is served every day with spectacular views.  And the market is a 3 minute walk.  Great location and lovely facilities.  First day there we had families of elephants right outside our porch ... an electric fence was separating us.  Awesome pictures of the elephants in the wild.  ❤️❤️❤️,2023-04-07
"Service the property the food , there is so much to do and it’s near the falls",2019-09-13
"Stuff was really great and attentive. Location is great, the swimming pool was nice, it was a pleasure staying at the kingdom, the only thing i didn't really enjoy was the breakfast and the furnishings needs upgrading.",2018-12-21
The stay was ok. Was not there long enough to know the place well,2022-06-20
A lovely resort that is clean and well equipped. The décor of the hotel adds to the African experience and the pool area is wonderful and well maintained. The breakfasts are great and the service top class. Good value for  money and highly recommended!,2016-04-06
"It looks somewhat like a Disney Resort (that’s not a compliment) and the rooms could use an updating. However, the staff is unfailingly polite and helpful and you can easily walk to the Falls and bridge from the property. It is the closet lodging to the Falls. Breakfast was good (not great). It was nice to chill in the pool after a hot day.",2014-11-29
"This property is very well located for those wanting to visit Victoria Falls.  The rooms are spacious and are fine for a short stay.  The guys on the gate are the friendliest there is and always asked what we were doing for the day and always asked how we enjoyed it when we came back, their service was fantastic and the rest of the staff should take note of how they do it.  The staff in the restaurant for breakfast were not attentive, you had to get their attention to get cups of coffee,  time was 6.30am in the morning when there was only a handful of us in the restaurant. The front desk was fine as well.  The other item that needs attention is the towels.  I know that not all hotels provide fluffy towels, but the threadbare towels that were provided to us on the first day in the bathroom were not acceptable, the next day the towels we got were better,but only just. The towels provided at the poolside had large holes in them, not a good look.  This hotel charges top prices but at best I think it is  3* hotel.  We did not eat at night in the restaurant as it is very expensive and based on the breakfast we didn't think the quality would be there.  Would I stay here again, unlikely, it would depend on the price.",2014-08-25
The staff go out of their way to be helpful. Just needs more people staying there,2023-08-22
"Food, staff and service all excellent. Breakfast and evening buffet plentiful. Great location in heart of iVictoria Falls. Pool area very clean and well maintained.
Room floors a little dirty.",2017-03-03
"Close to the Falls
Lots of space both in rooms and outside
Good food",2023-11-21
"The Kingdom has a great entrance, its all spacious and the pool area is fantastic.  The rooms are a bit dated but because of the African feel they get away with it. The staff are good but there is a feeling of sadness in the country as the people ""the staff"" who create the wonderful holiday for tourists are not looked after. Something needs to change and quickly!",2018-11-01
Very nice.  Facilities were good.  Staff was great.  Note.  If gambling at the casino.  They can’t always pay out US Dollar.  Make sure the cashier has USavailable for payout.  Was ripped off a little bit won a lot.  No worries I guess.  Was a great time with the love of my life!!!!,2019-07-26
"The location was convenient for activities and seeing the area.  The room was nice and the property had beautiful grounds and a pool.  The food options and restaurant facilities were not really to our taste.  We wanted to get something light to eat and there was nothing available on site.  The restaurant at the attached casino had more choices, but we still needed to walk into town for more options.",2015-02-11
The hotel design was great. The food was varied and excellent,2019-09-27
"An older type luxury accomodation, very good location, everyone was very friendly and helpful.  Pools were good, buffet tea and breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from.  Would certainly recommend to everyone.",2021-09-08
"Nice rooms that are clean and spacious--very African-themed which is wonderful. Beautiful attention to detail in terms of decor and cleanliness.  A bit too ""disney"" or they're trying to be, especially with dressed-up greeter at entrance.",2023-05-21
"Great Location for Falls and shopping. Foyer was lovely. Room, however, was something else altogether. Old, small and dark with an uncomfortable bed. The very ancient, free standing, air conditioner did not work properly, and made so much noise, you could not hear anything else, it sounded like a bus! It also flooded my room at 2am! The very old shower recess was so small, I couldn't turn in it when washing my hair (and I am NOT large!). Staff tried very hard and were pleasant. Service in the restaurants was often slow and an order was often misunderstood. This hotel is very overpriced (as are most things in Victoria Falls, where they use the US$ on a par with their currency). Zimbabwe has no money, so all banks are closed and ATMs are empty. Prices are very inflated. I would not recommend this hotel.",2021-08-29
"Never been to Zimbabwe before so booked this hotel from the UK, based on Expedia reviews. My partner and I turned up and were amazed: fantastic hotel, attentive staff, relaxed feel and just 10 minutes' walk from the entrance to Victoria Falls. The hotel is used to visitors being picked up for daily activities (e.g. River Cruise, Chobe Day Trip) so have someone outside assisting everyone being picked up. (When there was a delay with the River Cruise company picking us up, the hotel put us in a taxi and got us to the cruise moments before it left!). If I ever head back to Vic Falls, I'd book straight into The Kingdom again.",2018-03-12
Everything was nice and it is at a convenient place. Close to the falls which is a nice short walk,2022-06-13
Beautiful hotel.  It is beginning to need some updates but it is still a fabulous place.  I highly recommend it.,2018-03-27
Very friendly and helpful staff. The food in both restaurants was good and plenty of it.,2022-08-28
Perfect location... near everything...hard to find a better place in vic falls.,2022-08-17
"The hotel is expensive for the accommodation and meals. The area doesn’t appear safe. They have security guards however I was there when they guard took a break and immediately I was approached by a member of the public trying to sell me worthless Zimbabwe dollars for US$5 I refused but he followed me into the hotel near reception standing in front of me. I again refused and he said he will kill me, thankfully the tour guide I was waiting for saved me and told him off and told me to quickly go into the hotel. The tour guide said the hotel should have security at all times here. The hotel grounds are nice but they tried to  charge me breakfast when it clearly states it’s included. Close to the falls which is good",2015-09-15
Nice comfortable large hotel within easy walking distance to Victoria Falls. Very nice landscaping. Very distinct “Africa “ appeal. The dinner buffet at the hotel was very good as well as the complimentary breakfast. Friendly staff. Make sure you visit the native crafts market just one block away. Elephants wander around the walking trails right next to the hotel. Only negative was the very pushy locals trying to get you to buy the stuff they are selling.,2014-11-27
"Good location, good selection for breakfast although repetitive menu, friendly staff and near everything (walkable).  Our group went there for the marathon.  It is very convenient as the hotel is located at the start and the expo is at the hotel.  The hotel even have the list of tour operators that our group booked so that they could coordinate with the tour operators for pickup.  The rooms are a bit dated but functional.",2020-03-03
"I love this hotel, which has the most gracious staff and is such an excellent location for eateries and things to do around Victoria Falls. The added benefit is you get to see the occasional warthog on the premises! Just a first rate location, with all the amenities.",2020-06-28
"This was my second stay at this hotel and enjoyed it both times.
The only complaint I have is the evening meals at the hotel restaurant. They are expensive and the food is not good. We found this true both visits. Breakfast is very good and included in the room price, it is only the evening meals that are lacking, but don't let that keep you from booking as there are food places in the casino area that are OK.",2021-07-18
"An excellent hotel in the heart of Victoria Falls,;walking distance to the bridge over the falls; excellent service( unlike anything we are used to in North America) ; friendly and kind staff , in all regards.",2014-01-15
"I highly recommend The Kingdom....the service was exceptional( truly exceptional) , the hotel felt like an oasis for me between safaris.",2017-01-16
"This hotel is in the best location, so central to everything that you can do in Victoria Falls. The Staff were amazing so friendly, the room is very clean and i would highly recommended booking the activities with the adventure center in the hotel the staff were very friendly.",2015-03-13
There are not a lot of choices in and around Victoria Falls.  This is a good one and reasonably priced.  The region is very touristy with local hagglers practically attacking you to buy things on the street.  Local police should be more vigilant in keeping these people away from you as you try to shop with the legit businesses.,2018-04-10
"We could not have had a better time, thanks!",2018-07-20
Best location to visit Victoria falls (walking distance). Very pleasant people and safe to walk around.,2015-05-03
My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights while on holiday.  Nice accommodations close to the falls.,2017-05-06
The GM addressed our concerns immediately. Allowed us to exchange rooms. Great customer service. We really appreciated it.,2020-06-06
"If  you want to enjoy Victoria Falls in a safe, convenient, well cared for environment, The Kingdom is a great place to stay.  It isn't ""fancy"" but it's really nice and the staff are wonderful.  It's very clean and feels more like home.  Beds are really firm so that made it less comfy that we would have liked.  Other than that, we were really pleased!",2015-09-27
The hotel was great!  Only a short walk to Viictoria Falls!  The food was excellent at the main dining room and by pool side!  Would highly recommend to others!,2018-03-16
I loved the location of this lovely hotel and enjoyed the friendliness of all the staff. I highly recommend staying here when visiting Victoria Falls.,2022-05-24
"The room was airy, though being in Black B, difficult to reach with a suitcase with lots of stairs both up and down. By foot we managed to work out  better route to both the restaurant, and the reception area.  There was also a back gate leading to a path down to the falls. The buffet breakfast was vast selection and the waiters very helpful.",2023-04-23
"Hotel is nice. Friendly staff. Rooms are basic but very clean and convenient. They have nice balconies, sometimes with monkeys on it :-), which is a nice experience.

Bar area, where  you can also have lunch is very nice and with very friendly staff. The pool is beautiful.
Breakfast is ok, for dinner there other better place in the area I think.

I would definitly recommend the hotel. Just keep in mind it has about 300 rooms so it not very personal and has a lot of tour groups.",2017-10-09
The service was very good but the place was extremely noisy... you could here every person walking past your door (especially at 3am). But the kids loved it!,2014-07-13
"we loved our stay in spite of Zimbabwe inventing the cashless society:-)
the hotel was beautifull and comfortable and the staff from reception to the man who looks after the pool could not have been more helpfull and cheerfull
A realy memorable stay. Owen the pool man was brilliant!!",2014-10-02
"A very large hotel, can feel a little impersonal however excellent breakfast, ok rooms, lovely pool. The shower over the bath is a negative. It’s in a good locality within walking distance of the falls and the town’s facilities.",2016-09-01
"Desite the opening in 1999, the Kingdom looks much older and is below what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. 

The buffet is not kept warm and it varies very little from one day to another. The room and th bathroom are not very clean, but the pool is kept in perfect shape by dedicated staffs. the cocktails are not good, I would not recommend spending the 8-10 USSD they cost.

Do not use the expedia chat to book your transfer, as despite our confirmation nobody came to pick us up at arrival.",2020-10-29
"The hotel employees are very helpful and helped me by suggesting my activities. I must admit, flawless hospitality. The back gate of the hotel leads you to a very nice cafe with a view of the Victoria Falls Bridge and gorge. Love it!!",2017-06-07
"Excellent hotel with good facilities. Food very good. Very close to the Falls. 
A brilliant visit",2019-07-25
"Ideal location (a few minutes walk from the Falls), with comfortable rooms and very courteous helpful staff.  Good WiFi available and lovely swimming pool for daytime relaxation.  Highly recommend a stay here.  Just beware the baboons - and shut your balcony door!",2021-07-24
"The hotel was beautiful.  The problem was calling the hotel to request airport pickup. The number listed in Hotels.com is incorrect.  Took me 4 days to finally get through with the help of Hotels.com. very Very, very frustrating.  Hotel refused to comp my return airport shuttle. I feel I should have been comp'd because I spent too much money on phone calls from the USA and abroad. Please correct this error.",2019-04-14
"The Kingdom is huge and impressive, but very few were staying there when we stayed. Strangely for such a hotel, there was only one choice for dinner ant that was a very substantial buffet. Good rooms and staff.",2018-04-06
"Excelent! I want to thanks the personal of the hotel. They help us to found our lost bags at the airport and were very nice. Good and confort hotel, good breakfast",2021-03-29
Position in Vic Falls was very convenient to everything. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was very comfortable in the room but the bathroom was very dark and needs proper lighting over the mirror.  Overall a great place to stay when hotel is not at full capacity.,2023-10-22
The hospitality we received from arrival until we left made our holiday a memorable.,2014-06-27
"Great hotel, definitely better than rated.  I would glass this hotel as a high 4 star.  The hotel is located in the centre of where you need to be with walking distance to shops, bars and of course the falls itself.",2015-12-24
Just amazing.  The hotel is amazing.  Staff can't do enough for you.  Breakfast excellent everything you can think of.  Very close the Victoria Falls 5 minutes walk.  Look out cafe 5 minutes away.  Will definitely stay again.,2017-07-16
"All good. Lovely rooms, cleaned daily. Meals were also very good - including the lunches around the pool. great value for money. Close to the town centre so convenient quick walk to get to shops etc. Family had a good stay. Only dissapointment was having to pay extra for meals for my daughter as this was not included in the family rate.",2022-04-07
"The hotel was divine, would definitely come back",2019-02-04
"Amazing staff and service with great facilities 
Bathroom a bit dated and aircon very noisy but kept us cool.",2015-07-08
"Excellent holiday.  Friendly staff. Beautiful hotel and surroundings.
Will definately come back.",2017-07-21
We received a warm African welcome and check-in was quick. Our room was as depicted in the pictures. We especially loved the variety at breakfast.,2014-02-23
Amazing experience seeing the falls and having a dinncer cruise,2023-07-23
"Great hotel with a wonderful atmosphere & scenic grounds. Stay was spoiled by 1 factor: not able to amend a booking yet free cancellation/change was available online. We have been using Hotels.com for 5 years now because of the flexibility offered. This is the 1st time that we have not been able to amend a booking in the 5 years. We originally booked to stay for 3 nights from 30th Dec to 2nd Jan. Our travel dates changed to 29th Dec to 1st Jan, still 3 nights and we booked the extra night of the 29th separately to secure at such a busy time. When it came to amending the original booking (within the free change deadline) to check out on the 1st instead of the 2nd of Jan, hence maintaining 3 nights stay, both Expedia/Hotels.com and ourselves where advised to 1st cancel the initial booking then re-book the new dates. But availability could not be guaranteed even if we re-booked within a minute of cancelling. We tried to change on arrival at the hotel and were told to contact Expedia - same story. So, in effect we stayed for 3 nights but paid for 4 after travelling all the way from Maputo to enjoy the carnival although for some reason our reservation at the Kingdom reflected a check out date of the 1st and my online confirmation still reflected the 2nd. Strange. A blot on an otherwise fantastic time in Vic Falls. Luckily, Expedia stepped in and provided us with a voucher to cover part of the loss but in the end there was a R500.00 shortfall.",2020-04-10
"This is like a Vegas/ Disneyland hotel, there isn’t anything special about this place. Buffet was $35.00 a person and it was mediocre. 
Look for something more authentic instead.",2017-03-01
Enjoyed a lot of activities and the hotel is very scenic.,2015-08-03
Everything was good the only thing the a.c didn't work well but so far so good,2017-06-25
"I stayed there two nights. The hotel is huge.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The breakfast has a great variety.  The room condition was adequate.  The first room I was given had a faulty safe, so I was moved to another room.  This was fine except the refrigerator in the new room was practically impossible to open because of the cabinet it was in.  The opening of the door was blocked by the other things that surrounded it.  Other than that, I had a lovely stay and would recommend to others.",2016-04-29
"Stayed here for 4 nights, very convenient to all sights and shops, staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, Breakfast was good, large choice. Great pool area. If I had one thing that could be better it would be the beds, very hard, but as for everything else we had a great time.",2022-09-08
"Perfect location, walking distance to all the attractions I went. I easily walked to the falls, lookout cafe, Hi Tea at Victoria Falls Hotel next door and the Victoria Falls Bridge crossing over to Zambia.",2017-09-12
All aspects good but requires a bit of maintenance in the rooms amf bathrooms.,2015-06-11
We only stayed at The Kingdom for one night.  It was very pleasant stay. The service was excellent.,2023-07-30
"The hotel itself was in a great location within walking distance to the Falls,  brewery and restaurants. The room was fine. My first opinion was not the best especially since it was the last part of our honeymoon. Our room wasn’t ready right away. They told us it wouldn’t be a long wait for our room to be ready. They quoted me 15 minutes. 45 minutes later our room was finally ready. It was extremely hot that day so we unfortunately sat in the hot lobby waiting for our room to be available. Our stay in Victoria Falls was such a short stay with pre planned excursions so we had limited time to sight see. It was unfortunate we had to spend some of that available sight seeing time waiting for our room to be available. The excursion staff inside the hotel were delightful, kind, informative and helpful.",2021-04-20
Sensational location but take plenty US cash small bill as nowhere there to get any,2020-01-05
"There was hair in our food, when we wanted to called a manager we were ignored. Later the chef came out who was very friendly. Manager at restaurant is arrogant and unprofessional. There was no mosquito nets in the room and the stagnant water just outside our room was a huge breeding ground for them.",2018-01-30
Quick 2 night stay and enjoyed the facilities of the resort. The Victoria Falls are amazing and a wonderful experience to view its beauty. Only problem is hawkers once you leave for a stroll to shops....very persistent and hard to make them go away. Otherwise a wonderful time.,2014-12-01
"We had a 3 night stay here. The hotel was nice and staff were friendly and helpful.  The room was good enough, although some of the furniture looked a little worn. We ate breakfast here daily and the selection was good, as was the quality. We ate lunch here on occasion, a small menu and our meals sometimes arrived so much later than the other that the first had almost finished eating, although the lunch was always tasty.",2015-04-30
The Kingdom is a great hotel for anyone visiting Vic Falls and wanting comfort and luxury - the pool and open dining are great the constant noise of helicopters is a bit of annoyance but that’s the price you pay for the popularity of the Falls. The hotel has an excellent “back gate” that we used several times to see the river and falls from the lookout cafe (even saw game on the path to cafe),2018-05-31
Hotel was very nice.  Great location for easy walking to the entrance of the National Park for the Falls.  Staff was friendly and food was good.,2016-06-23
"This resort hotel kept providing me with excellent service and very unique architectural style of hotel reflected with local culture. Every staffs were kind and made me comfy. However Wifi system was so slow and unstable, and swimming pool was rather small comparing as the size of hotel.",2015-07-02
The location is good as you can easily walk to the falls.  It's a nice place that might actually be trying too hard.  The room was fine but the sliding door to the balcony had a gap to the outside even when it was closed.  There were a lot of mosquitoes in our room - that was our major complaint.  The staff was pretty helpful even though errors were made in both our airport pick up and drop off - they tried to make it right.  The pool is nice.  Eat dinner down the street at the Victoria Fall Hotel ... it was delicious!!!,2014-11-20
"Location of hotel is very near Victoria Falls (VF).  According to hotel staff who briefed us, the hotel is only 10 minutes walking distance to VF.   It is also within 3-5minutes walking distance to town centre and local shopping area. 

PROS:
(1) Central Location
(2) Great Buffet Breakfast

CONS:
(1) Mosquitos in room, just make sure you use the mosquito net provided to cover the bed and make sure that none of your body parts is near the mosquito net or you'll still end up with mosquito bites.",2022-12-24
"Staff was great and friendly.  Very good location and easy to find, however the hotel needs updated and the large water feature throughout the hotel likely contributes to the mosquito population that comes out at night.  The water was stagnant and landscaping needed attention....it was not appealing to the eye.  The rooms are old and our bathroom door wouldn't close all the way.",2017-08-07
"The public areas are good. However, the rooms are very dated. The staff are very formal and not too friendly. On the first night we had a buffet dinner at $US25pp. I felt it was overpriced and the quality was very average. Overall i felt given the condition of the rooms and the quality of service and food,  i think the hotel did not represent good value.",2015-06-11
Great place to base yourself.Close to Falls .village.and Lookout Cafe..good buffet breakfast. Staff very helpful .room clean and spacious..good value for money.,2017-05-20
"We spent two nights at The Kingdom. Location was great. Within walking distance to Victoria Falls and the Zambia boarder. Breakfast Buffett was included and was great. There was an excellent variety of food. We ate at the bar area by the pool for one of our meals. It was excellent. There is a desk in the hotel for booking tours and activities.  They were great to work with. The hotel staff was friendly.
Overall an excellent time.",2021-06-27
"this is old big hotel.
food is ok but room is not clean.
But location is very close from falls.",2017-02-06
Stayed here at end of a trip because wanted to luxury.  Staff very friendly and helpful. I think I was upgraded as had a nice second floor room with balcony facing the swimming pool which is in the centre of the complex.,2020-06-08
"Nice hotel for the price, clean overall the facilities are a little tired, breakfasts were good and dinners just adequate.",2020-05-01
As Victoria Falls is an isolated tourist bubble it is perhaps inevitable that hotels appear like sausage factories in the way they process guests. This hotel has a good location but is constantly filled with large tor groups and their themed dinner evenings. The hotel has absolutely no soundproofing,2020-05-19
"Great hotel. Nothing to criticise. Clean, well presented, lovely staff, great rooms, good food. My only tip to Vic Falls is bring your US dollars. The ATMs are all empty always....",2021-09-23
"Beautiful traditional African style hotel in close proximity to the Falls, good restaurants and amenities. The Kingdom has a great central location, staff are lovely, helpful and kind. Lovely clean room and in-house restaurant is excellent. There is a lot of activities to do, I recommend the river dinner cruise which was excellent with great entertainment. The family room was well suited to our need with a spacious double bed and a bunk bed for the kids. Our room was quiet and private with no disturbance from other guests. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I will definitely come back again.",2019-08-04
Super close to VA falls but have seen better hotels,2022-11-07
"The Kingdom has excellent choice for breakfast,comfortable rooms with well kept gardens.  The pool is popular with lounges to sir on if you don't want to swim.    The staff are all friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Within walking distance to the falls and some good restaurants   The Lookout Cafe is well worth a visit for the view also good meals served there fore lunch and  Dinner .   Friendly staff.   We were there 5 days",2021-01-11
"My wife and I stayed for a weekend in August. Check in was smooth and easy with a welcome drink. The room was clean and spacious with views of the garden. Breakfast was good, service was great. Can book tours directly with the hotel.",2022-07-12
"When I looked at the pictures of this hotel I thought it would be ok, when we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The Kingdom Hotel was much nicer than we had expected. Great value for money, great food, great service, closest location to walk to Vic Falls and to the shops down the street.",2023-07-23
"All fine... bit disneyesque for our liking. Staff lovely, service good, location great. We got a very cheap deal so cant complain on value for us .. we only wanted one night. Depends on what you want.. felt it was appealing to an American market.",2020-02-12
"only stayed for 1 night. room large, clean & comfortable. Staff friendly & helpful. Could do with a small bar inside, the night we were there it was cold sitting outside at the Bar. We did not want the buffet dinner in the restaurant but something light to eat. After discussing with restaurant manageress we were able to order one course from a la carte menu.  Lovely gardens & surrounds & in general Vic Falls town very clean.",2022-07-15
Please consider putting mats under the dressing table stools as they get dragged across the floor making very loud noises interrupting sleep.,2021-09-28
"Excellent location . The staff was very friendly, courteous. The food excellent. The swimming pool little green , nice warm water. The rooms were above expectations. Easy access to the Victoria Fall , Outlook deck , KFC chicken , strip mall , village market and fine restaurants . Only problem was smoking at the entrance and outside the main dinner hall. Highly recommend to the first timers",2015-08-04
"Room was fine for our family and had everything we needed. Porters were great and very helpful on a few occasions.  Only minor gripe would be 2 bathroom size towels, 1 pair of slippers, 1 sachet of coffee in the room for a family of 4 on arrival and or each day.  Having said that the staff were responsive when we asked for more.",2022-03-02
As close to the Falls as you can get on the Zimbabwean (best) side. It's a wonderful hotel.,2018-03-25
Awesome trip. Love the walking path to the falls. It was so convenient.,2018-11-05
"This was the perfect place for our 3 generational family to stay. It is within easy walking distance to the National Park, restaurants and shops. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Great buffet breakfast.",2020-07-31
"We enjoyed our stay here.  The rooms are clean and well furnished.  The breakfast buffet (included with our room) was very good with a variety of choices to appeal to all appetites.  It is a short walk to Victoria Falls, restaraunts, and shopping.  We would definitely stay here again!",2016-09-30
"The bed was quite firm so we didn't sleep so well. There was also some kind of audible vibration going constantly. It was louder in the bathroom than bedroom so it didn't interfere with sleeping but it was a bit annoying at times. It didn't ruin our stay or anything. It's just something they either should fix or warn people about.

Otherwise, the staff was incredibly friendly and the location was excellent!",2022-07-29
Great for a short stay (ours 24hrs). Closest hotel access to the Falls.  Security staff great walked us to the falls due a buffalo in the area downside bed old and very hard could feel the springs. Great shower very strong Grounds were beautiful,2014-11-09
"The hotel is located very close to VF entrance. Staff are very friendly, always accommodating your wishes. Premises are great. Breakfast is outstanding. Dinner buffet is a bit bland, but hey, you are not at VF for culinary experiences? 

Only area of improvement I would recommend is lighting in the guest rooms, they are really dim.",2017-07-29
"The hotel has a wonderful feel and a beautiful setting. It's right in town and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and to the falls. The room was nice buts needs a little updating and I found the bed to be hard. Service was great and everyone is very friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel.",2015-05-25
The staf were wonderful. The wifi was slow but great place and perfect location.,2020-07-31
Very spacious room and lobby. Staff were helpful. Nice ambience. Restaurant in grounds was reasonably priced. Souvenir store and tour agency in lobby add to convenience.,2021-01-23
"This hotel was really relaxed and comfortable, the people who work there are lovely and helpful, the breakfast was amazing, and the location is a very short walk to the Falls. Highly recommend. We arrived early at 11am and were allowed to checkin and taken straight to our room without any issues.",2017-05-19
We spend three days in this grand historic hotel and it was fabulous.,2017-09-18
Good but expensive----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,2023-04-05
"Great location at a very good price. Staff are excellent and friendly. Food of good quality. Clean and all facilities you could want. 
Internet when it works is fine, but needed to have new password and pin daily. Not a problem but an inconvenience. 
Love to have food and a beer by the pool and not have to pay silly prices, so very pleased with this when you can have a beer and lunch for less than $20.
Certainly would go back and have no problem to recommend this hotel to anyone",2021-12-03
"Great location for visiting Victoria Falls National Park and the bridge. It is 5 to 10 minutes walk to the entrance for the falls, either by road or a short cut at the rear of the hotel - both are very safe as is the township of Victoria Falls.
The hotel is very impressive, the buffet breakfast and dinner has been the best we have had in our 5 weeks in southern Africa. The staff were all very professional, helpful and friendly. Would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants to go and see Victoria Falls.",2016-10-04
"Great easy location to the Falls.  Could walk there easily as well as to the village. There are many street ""vendors"" as you leave the property who are relentless.",2023-08-11
Loved every minute,2015-12-04
"Nice, confortable and friendly experience",2014-05-08
"Amazing staff, professional and friendly.  Room very clean, a good size, with a balcony, though very basic and lacking in appeal.  No refrigerator, lighting poor, though a free, secure safe.  Wifi free, slow yet adequate.  Breakfast very good, evening meal expensive, it's a buffet, with very little choice, rather eat at the Spur, which is within the hotel, or at Boma, or the Victoria Falls Hotel, which is within walking distance.  We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Victoria Falls, yet this proved to be unimportant, as for tours you are collected from your hotel, so being further away is no problem.  This is a large hotel, with maze like corridors, and for us, it was quite a trek to our room.  The view from the room was pleasant, but not breathtaking. There is a small outside bar, where snacks and drinks may be purchased, service is slow!  Rather take a seven minute walk through the park to the Outlook Cafe, excellent views, and amazing food.  Enjoyable evening entertainment at the buffet, traditional musicians, though the experience was spoilt afterwards by being harassed by the entertainers to buy their cd's or dvd's.  Although the staff are superb, I would not return to this hotel, as the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge has so much more to offer.  However, I did truly enjoy my stay at The Kingdom.",2022-09-24

"This hotel is in a great location. Easy walking distance to Falls, lookout cafe, Victoria falls hotel, town shops and restaurants. The decor in the main areas is completely over the top ... like a B grade movie set it adds to the experience! Accommodation good. Facilities good. Bathrooms could do with a revamp.",2021-04-12
"We were warmly greated with a cold glass of mazoe ,check in waa pleasant and we got 2 rooms next to each other .We had requested adjoining rooms but just got 2 rooms next to each other ,no big deal we made it work. Our porter  insisted on walking us to our rooms and explained all the room features and that came in handy as some features needed explanation. The next 2 mornings breakfast was served from 6am -10 am with lots of varieties. Food waa well prepared and hot,our tea was served promtly and they had soy milk as a non diary milk option which was delicious!!!.We enjoyed the pool and there was plenty of towels and enjoyed some drinks by the pool which was not crowded at all.We ate from the hotel restaurant:Spurs and the food and service was excellent. Our overall 3 day 2 night stay was  marvellous can not fault this hotel for anything at all.Well done guys!! Keep the standards going!!",2017-09-13
"Great location easy to get around, a very good activity desk who will chop and change what you want as you want it",2017-09-22
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. Very easy to book activities in the lobby. The food was awesome at the restaurant downstairs. When it rained, there were several hotel staff there waiting with large umbrellas to escort you wherever you wanted to go. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The air conditioning worked great. Very roomy. We had a porch that overlooked an area where wildlife (baboons, wart hogs, birds) was sometime present. Wi-Fi was strong with a fair speed. Would of liked to have a microwave in the room (we did ask the kitchen if they would microwave two bags of popcorn we brought with us - they wanted $10 per bag).  Some reviews had mentioned mosquitos in rooms but we did not see any. We liked the fact that the Casino was separate from the hotel. A great experience.",2023-12-10
We had 3 days at the Kingdom Hotel which were really enjoyable ..... a great base for seeing the awesome Falls and taking advantage of the other activities on offer.,2017-01-05
"Very good four star hotel, excellent breakfast, good wifi, good rooms, friendly staff. Walking distance to the Falls entrance and also downtown. Airport transfers were on time.",2019-04-08
Staff were so helpful with very fast check in.  Free water in the room and tea and coffee making facilities.  Lovely welcome by ducks outside on the balcony.  So nice to be in a low level hotel with only two floors.,2020-09-29
"We really enjoyed this property, it's big with a pool in the middle, great breakfast that is included, staff is friendly. Rooms are decent. I'd recommend this hotel. The hotel is a 5-7 min walk to the falls and has a back entrance and a 5 min walk to town and is also next to the Vic Falls Hotel which has great views of the bridge to have a meal or snack on that property.",2017-09-17
"Excellent staff, good food, nice comfy rooms,pleasant decor and a real African feel.
Close to all major attractions.",2020-12-03

"Positive   but so insular from the outside world 


You could be anywhere.  In the current chaos of Zimbabwe a relief but usually for me to insular and disconnected",2021-05-28
"Hotel with a lot of potential if they updated their rooms. Mosquito nets required but not hung. Hard mattresses and lumpy pillows. Cannot enjoy terrace much due to mosquitos. Great location, walking distance to Victoria Falls and 2 minute drive from city center. Good buffet food for breakfast and dinner. Nice staff, well decorated.",2022-05-06
"Very disappointed in the hotel after seeing reviews. First, the hotel is very outdated and needs renovation.  Our first room was terrible and dirty with sand on the floor. The hotel did give us a new room, but one filled with mosquitos. We traveled during peak mosquito season- but clearly the cleaning staff was not aware of that as they'd keep doors and windows open during cleaning- so all mosquitoes got back into the room. Additionally- we had a do not disturb sign on door- and staff still entered room. All they needed was simple ceiling fans in hallway to keep mosquitos from room doors.
The food was terrible and over priced. Just terrible. Lastly, they wanted us to pay for transfer. Instead of waiting til check out, they stopped the key from functioning so we had to go to the front desk. Really don't know how this place is 4 star. More like 2 star,  if that",2016-01-18
"The facility was very nice... lovely pool area, room was spacious, restaurant had a lot of variety and the grounds were incredible.  As the weather was getting more humid and wet (end of November), the only issue would be mosquitoes.  I would recommend spraying your room before unpacking and keeping  bug spray with you when dining at night.",2014-11-14
Stayed 4 nights room was very comfortable and clean.  Would have been nice to have a small fridge in room.  Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice.  Wi-Fi was not working when we were there.  Staff were friendly and very helpful.  The location of the hotel is excellent as you can walk to both the Falls and the village itself.,2019-10-16
The Hotel was very confortable and at walking distance from the Falls and the village of Victoria Falls. The room was spacious with a balcony facing the lake. The hotel has beautiful gardens and a decor with an african ambience.,2020-09-26
Great location to the Falls and the local village. I felt the hotel was quite expensive for what was on offer but this seems normal for this location. Was disappointed that there was no fridge in the room. Staff were always very friendly and helpful. Would have preferred al la carte dining rather than only smorgasbord in the dining area.,2015-07-19
"lovely staff, friendly , professional and welcoming.",2017-04-27
"Good,",2022-06-26
beautiful property but the rooms need to be better maintained. Parts of the shower taps and sink vanity were missing. For the price paid you should be provided with a small fridge and not have to use powdered milk and drink warm water. Breakfast buffet okay but could have more options.,2016-05-14
Good hotel close to the Victoria Falls area.  Street souvenir sellers were constant and persistently annoying.,2015-04-02
10 minute walk to the falls. Be prepared for pressure from locals trying to sell you souvenirs.  At least they aren't just begging for money. The hotel is beautiful but but oddly laid out so will need to go up and down stairs to get to the rooms. No elevator.  Breakfast buffet had lots of variety though was the same both mornings we were there.,2022-02-25
"The Kingdom Hotel is ideally situated just a 5 minute walk from the entrance to Victoria Falls.  The hotel grounds are beautiful and well-cared for.  The ""deluxe"" rooms are quite nice although on the small size.  The balconies are lovely.  The non-deluxe, twin bed rooms are very small and disappointing.  The staff - particularly the guards are wonderfully helpful and friendly.  The restaurant and the staff were extremely disappointing. On all mornings (3) of our stay the buffet breakfast was poorly run - many items on the buffet were already consumed (breads, cheeses, yogurts, etc) and no attempt was made to replenish these.  When I requested a large glass to obtain water and juice from the buffet (where they have only very small glasses), I was told large glasses were not available.  I persisted and was finally provided a large glass.  With few exceptions, the wait staff were unpleasant, unhelpful and uninterested in being of service.",2015-06-03
Front desk personnel were very friendly and managed to check us in early.  Great service.  At breakfast the dining room ran out of coffee.,2022-08-08
The rooms have been poorly maintained. First of all there were bed bugs! I had over 50 bites during the first night. The AC wasn't working. We had to switch room. Furthermore the bath towels had holes. It needs a major renovation. The dinner buffet was not good at all.,2023-04-12
"Unreliable WIFI and electricity, however, I assume it is normal in ZW.
Most staff are nice, however, a bit of personal touch could be added, eg, advice on transport, advice of different sightseeings and best ways of doing things around there...etc.
The hotel is a bit tired but overall ok.",2022-03-05

"The pool was pleasant and our room was fine, with balcony overlooking the bar & pool, which was nice in the morning, but too much sun in the afternoon. Breakfast had a good selection and was good, but service was slow for coffee. We had snack at the bar..... Very slow, but good samosas & burger.",2022-05-24
"Front of house staff are friendly but that is where the service stopped. 
When requesting replacement of milk in our room because it had gone off, we were informed that we would have to pick it up from reception. The room was very small - too small to house two suitcases plus the bed.  Wifi was difficult to log on to. 
No sheets on the bed and the tissue box was empty. The toilet is so small that a large person would not fit. 
On the positive side it is located close the the airport in the Kindom Casino complex. There is a free shuttle to the airport.",2015-01-10
"Very, very friendly and helpful staff.
Excellent breakfast.",2015-11-08
"This is by far the best hotel I have stayed in! The best welcome I`ve ever received. Felt l was home! 
Kingdom l can not thank you enough for a lovely stay, it was my sister`s birthday and they upgraded us to a Kings suite for free! Which I thought was very kind of them and honestly unexpected. 
Van/Venna (sorry can`t remember her name) thank you. The staff are always smiling and happy to help. 

The environment is very relaxing and peaceful. Had the baboons and monkeys greet us good morning as well which was nice to wake up to :). Great wildlife around. 

Breakfast! I cant give it justice here, you  have to experience it yourself to just understand. 

Totally recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Vic Falls. It might sound ridiculously over priced, but trust me your money will be worth it! 

Definitely coming back again!",2018-12-21
"The Kingdom was a very comfortable hotel with good service. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The food was very good at breakfast. We didn't eat lunch or dinner there. We stayed at another hotel when we came back from safari that was more expensive, but it was not better. You will have a nice stay at The Kingdom.",2021-03-09
"The staff were amazing and could not do enough to help. I became ill one morning and was walking to reception from our room when I could not go any further. The staff were quick to provide a wheel chair so i could sit down and get to the bathroom. they called an ambulance (and even paid for it) and got me to hospital quickly. The overnight stay in hospital came to over USD 1,200 so I can only imagine how much extra the ambulance trip would have cost us. Thanks to to management and staff at the Kingdom.",2014-07-15
The 15 day biking tour starting from South Africa finished for us at kingdom hotel.   My bag which was strapped across my body with phone money and credit cards was stolen off me without me noticing.  The manager went to a lot of trouble retrieving cctv footage which showed me leaving the hotel with bag and returning 11 mins later without it.    At least I knew it happened in the street and not on the hotel premises.   The staff at the kingdom were very friendly and helpful.  Biggest problem was the venders outside hastling the tourists,2023-04-07
"the hotel exceeded our expectations, better than the pictures online. convenient to shopping, the falls, the Zambian border. Good breakfast. If any issues, suggest you try the guest desk where they sell excursions - they were very helpful.",2019-06-27
"We were only able to stay one night at your hotel, due to our other travel plans.  We enjoyed the short time we were there, the surroundings and little town.  Your breakfast was huge and plentiful.  Delicious too.  We will definitely return some day.",2023-01-16
"Nice hotel in a great location. Very friendly and helpful staff, couldn't be faulted. 
On the negative side, the restaurant is good for breakfast but poor for dinner. And there aren't many good restaurants to visit nearby. I don;t understand why the hotel doesn't have a better restaurant, or tow or three restaurants to choose from. Guests don;t really want to go out, but they have to because the restaurant is poor. Also the wifi was very unreliable. Nearly a great hotel, but not quite!",2016-07-24
"The falls were great but the village is run down, littered and dusty. Tourists are constantly harassed by street vendors. The kingdom is an expensive budget hotel, our room was very basic with few amenities, the breakfast buffet was very average.  We had a buffet dinner and cultural show next door at the the Vic Falls Hotel which was fabulous.  We also took a Sunset cruise which was superb and would recommend.  We stayed two nights and this was enough to see the falls and do the cruise.  Happy to have visited but would not go back.",2021-08-05
"I stayed a week at the Kingdom -- longer than most tourists, I gather, who largely only come for a day or two. I can recommend the hotel for a long stay. It is a pretty place, a ten-minute walk from Victoria Falls, with a large menu of activities that can be arranged through the Adventure Connection desk -- safaris, rafting, ziplining, sunset cruises, walking with lions, you name it. I stayed busy my whole time. The staff were wonderful. I had some difficulties with my luggage, which was delayed and then got stuck at customs at the airport, so that I had to go fetch it. The staff tried to negotiate for me with the airport, then arranged for me to share someone else's airport transport, to save me some money. They gave me a complimentary spa treatment and drinks by the pool to make up for the trouble I'd had. And for the next couple of days, when I saw various staff, they would ask, ""did you get your bag OK?"" Made me feel well taken care of. I could easily have stayed another week.",2017-02-21
My stay at Kingdom Lodge was very pleasant. The staff was extremely helpful and I enjoyed the breakfast.,2016-05-08
"5 mins walk to falls, but hotel bit run-down and not maintained!  We were in Kings Club but nothing special was done or felt like in service.  Service very slow in general and food choices bare-bones, a second restaurant they have has menu but offers only few items.  Wifi service is terrible as well.",2015-01-20
The  Kingdom was a very nice hotel. The people could not have been nicer or more helpful. It is close to the Victoria Falls and local shopping. Able to walk to everything. Enjoyed my stay and would stay there again.,2015-04-22
"generally a good hotel with excellent service. However, the internet service was terrible and staff was not helpful with this. Also, we did not have mosquito netting in our room and woke up covered with mosquito bites.",2020-06-23
"Excellent hotel, great value for money and excellent breakfast.",2020-05-05
"Although not a five star by any means this hotel and it's grounds are stunningly beautiful. It's very resort like so while inside there's only a view of its gardens (unlike the Victoria Falls hotel nearby which actually looks onto the gorge and the mist of the falls in the distance). The gardens are pretty though. Rooms are OK comfort-wise. Not dingy but not overly fancy. Modern, spacious bathroom with nice hot showers. Breakfast is a big spread buffet style with lots of options. Best part is that you have a back path to the gorge lookout and the falls are like 10 minutes walk away. It's also close to town so you can go to the shops and cafes in 5 minutes on foot. Staff are all very friendly.",2014-01-01
"We stayed at the Kingdom July 6-7.  Hotel exterior was clean, the check-in was quick, the rooms are clean.  The bed is quite firm, the shower head is along the side of the tub, not the traditional end of the tub you may be accustomed to, and the shower curtains don't cover the entire side of the tub.  Still, that wasn't a problem.  Bring power converters/adapters as necessary and keep your balcony doors locked to prevent unwanted visits by the local monkey population (good advice for all Vic Falls hotels).  The hotel is large, well situated and convenient (walking distance) to most locations in Vic Falls.",2017-04-29
"Had a great time , hotel breakfast was really good. The falls were spectacular as were the activities..this hotel is so centrally situated",2014-12-04
"Nice hotel with a walking path to Victoria Falls, rooms are clean and spacious, only negative is the room had mosquito's. The dinner buffett was pricey so we choose to walk to a nearby restaurant.",2023-10-30
Had a wonderful stay at The Kingdom. Really enjoyed the elephant having breakfast every morning in the bush outside our room. Great breakfast. Beautiful grounds. Excellent location.,2021-02-26
"The location is great, the common areas are nice, the rooms themselves look a bit old but overall OK.

The WiFi in the rooms is unusable. It connects for 2 minutes then doesn't work for 2 minutes and so on (experienced by others too). I reported the problem, nothing was fixed.

Has I known this in advance I would probably not book the hotel.",2015-12-11
Superb hotel. I've always wanted to stay here and it exceeded my expectations. The hotel is greatly situated close to town and to the falls with its own private access to it. Would definitely recommend this to friends and would stay again,2021-06-05
Downside - the room did not have a fridge or a TV.,2015-03-11
"Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Kingdom. Lovely room, beautiful grounds, relaxing pool, easy access to Vic Falls and other activities.",2023-05-03
Three star value at five star prices,2016-01-05
"We only spent one night in Vic falls to see the Victoria Falls and The Kingdom has a short cut to the falls, so excellent location.",2014-01-09
"We chose this hotel for it's value and proximity to the falls and were not disappointed.

We loved the hotel! We read some reviews that said it was in need of renovation, but aside from elevator doors that seemed to use a lot of effor to open, we though it had a great rustic African vibe.

There was a gate off the back of the property that was open from 6am to 6pm. There was a short walk through some public land to the Victoria Falls Park entrance. A security guard escorted us all the way. He warned us that there were wild animals out there, including elephants, but we were unlikely to see them through the foliage. There were several branches off the main route. Some leading to a restaurant or other hotels. Much to our chagrin, the path back had no signs indicating which paths would lead us back to our hotel. We decided to play it safe and stay on the main/paved path which ran along the road. It was a bit longer than crossing through the forest, but we knew we wouldn't get lost.

The walk into town was nice, but be prepared to be accosted by street vendors. They are very persistent, but harmless. Once you cut through the gas station parking lot across from the hotel, it is a short walk to shops where you can find restraunts, liquor, curios, salon (with a $5 mini-manicure special for Valentine's weekend) so we strolled arount there a while. There is also a craft market within walking distance with dozens of vendors of African Crafts.",2017-07-17
"We booked two rooms to be close to our friends...we couldn't have farther away.   In order to have two functioning rooms we had to move twice.
They don't have screens on the windows and there are so many bugs you can't leave the windows open.  when you leave your room the AC goes off, so when you return, the room is like a sauna.  Had a giant spider in my room.  The lobby is not air conditioned, so sitting their waiting for a pick up is very sweaty.   The check in was ridiculously slow as they wanted to explain a worthless point system.  Very cool exterior architecture but the personal rooms are nothing special.",2021-11-19
Horrible food! Leaking roof! Bad service...,2018-10-16
"Convenient walk to Vic Falls and Elephant Walk shopping. The grounds are breathtaking and the rooms are small, but adequate. It was convenient to have Wild Horizons located inside the hotel to book excursions with. That said...The Kingdom's food quality is terrible! Breakfast and dinner buffets were the worst we have been to. Poor selection and poor quality. DO NOT eat at this hotel...walk next door to Victoria Falls Hotel, or across the street to Nan Tuk Chinese/Thai. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the food options and quality, the manager was very unresponsive. Other guests overheard and shared with us they felt the same way. We also wish either the hotel desk or Wild Horizons would have told us about other things within walking distance i.e. Overlook Cafe, etc. We found out about them from other guests as we were checking out. Quite disappointing.",2018-05-26
"The hotel reception staff were unfriendly when I asked to change rooms, because I was expecting a room with a balcony.
In our room, the balcony doors would not lock. The furniture in the room was dated and needed modernising.
The hotel breakfast was left to stand with nothing covering it up, so was subject to flies. When asking for a cappuccino at breakfast i waited 15 minutes the first day for it to arrive and 10 minutes the next day after asking 3 times.
The hotel location is excellent but was hassled and harassed every time I left the hotel.",2021-09-28
"Very friendly and helpful staff with special mention for Freedom, who tends the grounds, swimming pool, keeps the wildlife at bay and is always willing to take photos for guests. Having been warned about mosquitoes, we asked for a net for the bed and it was installed in our room within 10 minutes. No bites!
The waterfall is a 10 minute walk and Leon, one of the hotel security staff, escorted us as the path tends to have persistent hawkers, selling carvings. There is a lot of that in Victoria Falls, everywhere you go. Having seen the waterfalls, there is little else to go back for but for anyone who has not been we would recommend The Kingdom and The Boma restaurant nearby where we had a great time.",2014-03-25
"The Kingdom is like a faded movie star; definitely worn out and dated, but you can still see a semblance of its old glory around the edges. There was nothing really wrong with it (except the unacceptable lack of internet access in the rooms), but nothing outstanding, either (except the almost-perfect location between town and the falls.

I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, either. Just like seeing an older movie star past his or her prime, I guess...",2020-11-10
"The hotel is in a great location. But it really needs to work on updating a lot of things.
The ""free-wifi"" just doesn't work, so you'll see everybody going down to the lobby to use it.
The bed is so uncomfortable your back will hurt.
Make sure you get breakfast included in your reservation. If you don't, you'll need to pay $27 (!!!!) per person for a buffet breakfast (which opens at 7, so it will probably not work with the activities where they pick you up at 7)
Also, get ready to pay $2 if you want a small bottle of water.
Ah, don't get laundry done! we did and they gave all our clothes back clean and folded (Yay!) but with a stapled paper tag on each piece (boo!) 2 or 3 staples for each tag, just in case... I spent a while removing about 80 staples. No discount after complaining ($46) Seriously, they ruined a few pieces...",2019-03-23
"It was a great getaway for the new year and the hotel couldn't be better. Beautiful, serene place.",2019-03-25
"Poor service, expensive, mediocre food and air conditioner not working in close to 40 degree heat and no offer to change rooms in spite of hotel not being full.",2019-06-16
A family holiday with my folks and sister. What a great stay. My mom is in a wheelchair and all of the hotel was very accessible for her. The staff went out there way to make sure you were ok. Didnt need to move more than a few steps from the pool chair to the bar before the barman came running to get our order. Even the lovely gentleman for pool towels brought us towels and helped us get in and out of the pool. The food was really good especially the breakfast which had a vast selection to suit all tastes. The bacon and the liver were exceptionally good. Worth every penny!!,2021-08-11
"Soo close to the falls which the ultimate bonus.
No fridge in the room :(",2018-05-17
This hotel is wonderful. It's location allows you to walk to Victoria Falls via a gate with a guard to help you on your way. From my room I could hear the sounds of the Falls and it made sleeping so wonderful. The breakfast is FANTASTIC with lots of food choices and eggs made to order. The staff at the hotel are very attentive and try very hard to make your stay a good one. I am already looking forward to my next stay there.,2014-12-24
"Nice room. No bathrobes. Breakfast fairly poor with terrible coffee and orange 'drink'. I asked if they had orange juice and, after trying to give me more of what I already had and didn't want, I was finally brought fresh juice.",2017-12-27
"Great location and well kept facilities for older hotel. However, in 2015 to ask $3.00 to use a computer to check-in for your flight and not having a printer for boarding passes is very outdated. Likewise, a flat rate buffet dinner ($27.00) should include water. $2 for each small bottle of water is a bit much. The hotel is operated on premise you won't be coming back so we'll nickel and dime you whenever we can.",2020-02-27
"This hotel is in need of a makeover. The setting is nice for the pool area and restaurant but that is about it. At $250USD a night it is very expensive for what you get. The rooms are quite spacious but there is no fridge, a shower in the bath and only black teabags provided (Rooibos had to be ordered through room service!). The buffet breakfast was terrible apart from the eggs and omelettes that are cooked to order. The fresh fruit is limited and tasteless, pastries are dry, pancakes are cold and many things run out. We chose not to have the buffet dinner here because of the breakfast. The pool bar was unable to provide cold beer or white wine. I had ice blocks in mine. The pools are not particularly clean with grit or dirt at the bottom.
The staff generally though are very helpful.
Why there is a casino here, I'm not sure. It is empty as are the 2 fast food restaurants and looks very tacky.
This hotel does not live up to it's advertising of features and facilities. It is however close to the Falls which was a main consideration for staying here.",2014-07-27
"This hotel is very convienent for a short stay in Victoria Falls. It is the closest to the Falls themselves which are a 5 minute walk away. It's a big chain type hotel. Rooms are and bathrooms are big and there is plenty of hot water, beds are confortable, but shairs are unfit to sit in. A bit of renovation could turn it into a 4star. Be aware that rooms on top floor may be very noisy due to humidity extractors on the roof. A/C is a joke. Nevertheless I would recommend for a 1-2 night stay and with what you save you can do some fine dining close by.",2023-04-19
"Victoria Falls was excellent!! The Kingdom Hotel made the stay that much more enjoyable. Staff was great, breakfast was great, security was great, location was great, dinner show was great, and value was outstanding!!!",2019-02-20
Perfect location to stay in Victoria Falls. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is quite friendly. The town is safe for tourists. It's best to experience local restaurants for food and drink as the hotel buffet it very expensive.,2023-09-27
"Excellent service, friendly and helpful staff",2021-12-13
"Friendly and helpful staff, great facilities and refreshing pool for those hot days.  Morning breakfast was awesome, plenty of choice on offer to start your day with heaps of energy for all the nearby activities on offer!",2019-01-21
"We had a wonderful exprience, from reception and all round. Fantastic service.",2023-02-21
"Very good location for Victoria Falls - the back of the hotel has a gate on the path leading to the Vic Falls reserve & also leading to a lovely cafe on the edge of the gorge with a view to the railway bridge. The buffet breakfast & dinner were good & there was plenty of fun to be had in the pools. There are 4 pools, for ages from toddlers upwards. The grounds are nicely landscaped with indigenous vegetation & a haven for birds. The staff are lovely. We had a great time.",2022-07-27
A very pleasant stay and the hotel is a close walk to the Falls and into town so very well located. Staff and service were great. Will definitely be back!,2015-04-01
This is a beautiful hotel situated very close to Victoria Falls. Room was clean but had a couple of mosquitoes. Nothing a bit of DEET couldn't sort out! Staff was friendly although given the wrong room first but it was sorted out quickly.,2022-01-17
Great location to visit the Falls. You can walk there. You can also walk to/from the Zambia border to the hotel in about 10 minutes. No need for a taxi. Room was nice. Wifi didn't work too well. Staff were all very friendly and we were able to check in a couple hours early. This is also where the Intercape bus stops if you're going to Hwange National Park.,2023-03-18
"great place in Victoria Falls, close to everything, great value!",2019-03-26
An All Black Wallabies test was on live TV in the Hotel -  Bonus.,2020-01-31
"The Hotel did really give you a Kingdom feel with the architecture of its entrance and setting - spacious, quiet, and roomy. Rooms could be reached by walking through their garden and pond with big fat ducks swimming around, which created a peaceful environment and relaxing atmosphere throughout the complex. Footpath at the back of the Hotel leading to part of the Victoria Falls in about 5 - 10 minutes’ walk with a few warthogs near the Bar. One could easily spend some time there in the lazy afternoon or take the short trail to admire the Falls from a distance.

The Kingdom was located close to town (5 minutes’ walk) where different types of eateries were there. One could easily walk to town for lunch and dinner (better take the taxi for return at night). It was a good location to be picked up for activities and sightseeing at the Falls.

Room was large but a bit dated with old furniture. We got a room with balcony overlooking the pond which was a nice and pleasant spot to relax after the day’s activity. Breakfast was included in our room rates but food was just average.

During the time of our visit, The Kingdom was not very crowded and it appeared that it was a place popular with matured couples and seniors.",2019-08-20
We booked 2 rooms for the Victoria Falls Marathon.  Knowing that we would not be able to check out at the required time we asked for an extension. The staff was accommodating and when we checked out we received a boxed breakfast that we devoured after the race.,2015-04-16
"This hotel is in wonderful location, you can walk out the back gate and down the path way to the falls. The room was comfortable with a nice balcony overlooking the ponds. However a refrigerator in the room would have been good. The restaurant only offers a buffet dinner at night but if this doesn't appeal to you, there are good restaurants nereby. Overall the hotel is slightly rundown but much less expensive than it's famous neighbour",2022-11-05
"This was a one day/one night stop over to see the Falls and surrounds.
We packed as much as was possible into the time we had and the Hotel played it's part in this regard.
Room was ready mid morning,staff were particularly helpful in organising activities/sightseeing etc",2016-04-08
Great stay at the hotel within walking distance of Victoria Falls and town centre.  Great vibe and outdoor pool area.,2018-07-19
"Excellent location, excellent food, great room and most of all a great staff. Very helpful in everyday. I travel all the time literally and this was a great experience.",2023-06-27
"I found the hotel a good value and quite comfortable overall. I was a little surprised that you have to make special arrangements to charge drinks/dinner to your room while there, but it worked out.",2016-10-17
The hotel is very close to the falls.  We just walked about 1/3 mile.  Beware of the elephants!  Near this hotel is a restaurant overlooking the gorge.,2016-12-20
Excellent service and location.  Great experience,2022-03-28
On my arrival I was escorted to my room which I requested to be changed as I do not like stairs. This was done within a couple of minutes without any fuss. A buffet is offered every night. African entertainment during the dinner. Pools are nice and clean. Rooms are clean and serviced every days,2014-10-14
Very close to the Falls even a path that leads to the gorges. Beautiful settings with monkeys and birds around the hotel.Very African.,2014-11-20
"this was a 3 star hotel, but we thought it should have been 4 star.
clean room huge bed good size bathroom and balcony overlooking the pool and natural lake. Be prepared to use US dollars. The hotel was walking distance to the Falls and small township. If you want to make trips into the surrounding areas, ie Chobe Nat Park make sure you have the multiple visa entry costing US$50.00 at the Zimbabwe airport. Very good breakfast. Friendly staff.",2016-02-18
Nothing special,2020-03-03
"The place is well located, very nice grounds and general areas very well kept, casino okay but was empty when I was there, beds on the hard side for my liking, shower/tub little funky, good pressure and plenty hot water, just old narrow tub and shower head on side not end as usual. If you walk to the Falls the hawkers are relentless!!!",2019-06-28
"I  they had better wifi service 
The problem I had was with the high dinner prices",2021-09-06
"Only stayed one night,too short,and will go back as plenty to see and do in Vic Falls.Very safe and friendly.But using US dollars it is a bit expensive but well worth a visit.",2023-12-11
Fantastic stay... great ambiance & decor... coupled with very helpful staff made our stay quite memorable. Will stay there during next trip as well; & recommend it for anyone planning for a great vacation there.,2021-08-10
Super,2023-07-07
We had a fabulous time! The hotel was very clean and very safe. We booked with Expedia and breakfast was included which was helpful before our early morning excursions we booked through Wild Horizons which is in the lobby.,2016-07-17
Excellent! !,2020-06-09
"first room a/c didn't work, so it was too hot.
2nd room a/c wouldn't turn off so it was too cold.
found cockroach in first room.
food was good",2022-10-17
Great location especially for price. Rooms really clean and comfortable. It is a little tired in places and the price of the breakfast it my opinion is ridiculous (27$ pp) we had it one day and it wasn't worth it. Swimming pool is lovely great for kids. And lunch prices much more reasonable. You can walk to most things inc falls and zamb.,2018-02-19
"I went there alone hoping for some introspection...I got more than I bargained. The hotel was a lovely place to stay in - I like the architecture, even if it's a little bit old fashioned. No fridge in the room meant I had to constantly call room service for ice to cool my drinks...annoying! Some of the furniture was kind of falling apart and needed some repairing. The pool needs constant attention to keep it clean - it was never clean enough. Otherwise I enjoyed the staff friendliness and quick attendance to the requests I made. I felt comfortable and would recommend to anyone. I didn't take the package of the breakfast because I felt it was pricey...it was generally cheaper to order food (breakfast/dinner) via room service or walk to town (not far) to eat out there if I had no other plans.",2015-03-30
"Vic Falls was great, and the hotel is conveniently situated as you can actually walk to the falls. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The restaraunt food however is rather overpriced. There is the Spur and Panarottis in the casino area but they dont have the selection that these outlets do, for example they dont have any hot veg and at times they have no potatoes. I also received a very dirty glass once, so the quality and service standard of these 2 outlets are rather dismal. They are also priced at 2 to 3 times that of a South African Spur so not really value for money there. Food options in the area are a bit low. There is not much variety for vegetarians and a stay longer than a few days would be too difficult if you are vegetarian.

The hotel itself is good. It makes for an okay stay for a few days.",2016-12-09
"Clean, quiet, comfortable, close to town & the falls",2014-07-19
VERY ACCOMODATIVE staff. Plenty of greenry and well developed surroundings.,2014-06-10
The staff were lovely - very friendly and helpful.The hotel is next to a path that runs alongside the river and a strolling along the path is a great opportunity to watch the wildlife,2017-04-04
"Noise created by the air condition disturbed sleep at night.
Restaurants quality should improve.",2023-02-12
The location close to the Falls helped us walk. The directions to reach the Falls were not good for a first time visitor.,2014-10-02
"We stayed at the Kingdom for 2 nights from the 9/7/14 to the 11 /7/14 . We enjoyed our stay however identified the following as areas for improvement.

In our room we could not completely close the privacy screen behind the sliding class doors which provided access to the balcony leaving us exposed. The rooms did not contain an iron or ironing board and must be requested. While staff will deliver to your room upon request they are also very anxious to retrieve it. Not sure why this is, perhaps they only have a few available for the entire hotel but this became a little inconvenient for us.

The quality of food available for breakfast was fine however during the ""peak breakfast rush"" at around 7.30 to 8.30am some basic things such as bread for toast, and condiments were not available even when requested from staff.

Staff were courteous enough, however the table service for breakfast was poor. We were asked by a number of waiters if we would like coffee/tea with our breakfast and despite confirming that we did, we did not receive anything. On our first morning we were shown to a table then invited to help ourselves to the buffet and upon returning to our table found that other guests had been seated at our table.

None of these issues would prevent us from returning, however they do detract a little from the experience and may put some people off.",2019-12-05
"Have stayed here numerous times and the quality and service is still great. The breakfast buffet is amazing and the evening buffet has so many choices. Find the bar relaxing and friendly. Have sent my friends there the past two months as they have had business meetings in town. Even though I pay, they have had no problem checking in. They have another quick meeting in August.
Great property.",2018-03-09
"Loved our stay here. The staff were great. The room was clean and comfortable, and baboons and warthogs wandered past our balcony. Only a short walk to the falls, although the street vendors could be a pest. Would love to stay here again.",2023-11-24
"Nice, and very close to the Falls.",2023-01-31
"The Kingdom still has the best swimming pools in Vic Falls so if you’re planning on spending a lot of time by a pool- a visit to the Kingdom is definitely worth it. On arrival, we had some traditional ‘warriors’ collect our bags from the car and were given wet towels and fruit juice at reception. The room was lovely, spacious and clean however I wasn’t pleased at the level of service I’d received with regards to the room. When I arrived, I was checked in to a room facing the back of the hotel (which was just grass) and had 2 twin beds pushed together claiming to be a King sized bed, which was what I paid for. I got another room from reception without any hassle but as the hotel was empty, it amazed me that the few guests they had staying there weren’t given the best rooms they had. The time taken to receive drink and food orders is atrocious…at one point it took them half an hour to get a pepsi light from a bar that was a few feet away. As far as entertainment goes, there’s not a lot to do in the evenings at the Kingdom as the casino bar is never fully stocked, the machines at the casino’s all seem to have something broken, and all the chairs at the bar are falling apart. It probably doesn’t sound like it, but I did enjoy my stay at the Kingdom. It’s just upsetting to see what it’s become from what it was a decade ago.",2015-07-28

Staff is always polite and helpful. Breakfast is very nice. We stay here a few times a year and really do enjoy it. However the price continues to increase.,2016-04-05
It was lovely,2019-12-03
Falls can be conveniently reached through a path located at the rear of the hotel. Only annoying issue is that the moment you exit the hotel you will be surrounded by locals selling al kind of local handcrafts at high prices.,2020-10-25
Wonderful stay. Beautiful hotel in the African bush.Would go there anytime again.,2018-12-28
The hotel had a nice feel and breakfast was great. I thought it was a bit expensive for what you actually get but it was in a good location. The hotel was clean and reasonably well maintained but we found that the water was not hot. A person finally fixed the problem at after 9.30pm saying that the hot water had been turned off in another area. Our hot water was not working the in afternoon when we checked. Apart form that it was a good hotel.,2017-08-17
"Great stay, would recommend this.",2014-01-14
"Arrived for a one night stay at the end of an overland trip. Welcomed on arrival with refreshing lemonade and helpful door staff.

Would definitely stay here again.",2021-03-07
"Warm welcome from the hotel staff,no issues checking in, requested for room for our 2 older kids close to us which was done,nice room with pool views.The food was delicious and had a section with traditional foods ,the chef could prepare for you food as per request ie omellets,traditional dancers were good. Clean rooms. The manager was very helpful and I had a surprise birthday day cake and coffee from the hotel.The only thing I would suggest is maybe free internet access for guests,but overall very pleasant stay and would stay again next time.Well done Kingdom hotel!!!!!!!",2016-10-12
"This hotel is fantastic, we had a glorious experience ! The whole scenery is so beautiful, more so because of the Africa theme that is so evident and so appropriate.

The staff is so professional the customer care is next to none!
The food is excellent although I would suggest that the food warmers be improved to ensure that food when served is hot",2019-01-07
