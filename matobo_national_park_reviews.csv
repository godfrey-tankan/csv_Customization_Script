"Awesome day out, RHINOS ARE AMAZING!!"
Incredible park and team of rangers and tour operators trying to save Rhinos. We had the local legend Ian as our guide for the day and he was amazing. Heartbreaking to hear about the poaching that is still happening. The painting in the park were amazing!! as were the rhino of course. This place is a must visit. You'll have an awesome day and contribute some tourist $'s to helping protect the rhinos.
"Beautiful setting, chance to see rhinos"
"This park is not often visited because you won't spot many animals on game drives, and it isn't on the main circuit for tourism. But it's easy to get to from Bulawayo and has spectacular scenery, with hills, rock faces, and boulders that are gorgeous all day and with the sun setting. There are also 13,000-year-old cave paintings and a chance to see rhinos in the wild (even on foot).  Very peaceful, pretty, and photogenic."
Excellent Day out
"Our knowledgeable guide first took us to see the Bushmen Cave Paintings, explaining their way of life, which was interesting.  There isn't that much there by way of the paintings you just walk up a short way to the rock and come down again.We then went on to see the Rhinos up close, now this was special, right up close and personal.  If you do nothing else on your visit do this part.  We were on foot and had to walk a short distance through the bush, obviously as they move around there is no set pathway so covered footwear and if you are not too steady on your feet, this may not be for you.We finshed off with a visit to Cecil Rhode's Grave, again very interesting.  There are loos in the car park here.  The actual grave is at the top of a steep climb, in itself not difficult but if you are not particularly mobile then forget it.  The views from the top are breathtaking.We arrived by rail and it is a 45 min transfer from Bulawayo station."
The reality of conservation
Seeing rhinos and drinking in the incredibley breathtaking panorama from World's View. I am sure this where God started creation. The National Parks staff were knowledgeable and it is very humbling to actually meet the dedicated human beings protecting animals facing extinction as they patrol the parks . When you visit find out how you can be a part of supporting the scouts and the communities protecting wildlife and being an active part of conservation. These men and women put their lives on the line for conservation.
Amazing landscape
"Loved this National Park,  such different landscape to other places. Rocky terrain and lush green surrounds. There are many caves within the park, many with ancient rock paintings by the San bushmen. We were lucky to see 6 large rhinos in the park too. Our guide, Adrian,  knew a lot about the plant life within the park too. Cecil Rhodes final resting place is,also here. That costs 10US to visit  but there's a fabulous view without going right up. Viewpoint called World's View. Breath taking. We didn't see many animals but the rhino were spectacular."
"Great views, some animals, and interesting stories"
"The park is unique, I believe for its stone mountains which are quite an amazing site.  Your experience, I believe will depend on your tour guide.  We didn’t go to Rhodes grave, although I would have liked to visit the former residence as part of understanding the man.  We visited with a local elder for a view of some cave paintings as well as going to visit a local family in huts.  These visits added tremendously to our experience.  We did manage to see some animals from a distance but we didn’t do the rhino walk."
A Memorable Day
"We came as part of our included tour Game Drive and we opted for the optional extension at a steal $20USD per person which offered us 4-5 more hrs. Lunch was included and was delicious and simple.We had Andy as our guide who made the entire day one of the best drives.  Even though we didn't see a ton; we did get to walk in the bush to get close to a rhino, saw some other animals and the landscape was breathtaking.  The hike to the grave and native paintings were lovely and the overall day was memorable.I would recommend this park as it is beautiful and with a good guide like Andy will make it worthwhile."
Unique one-off landscapes.
"Yes, a MUST visit and one that further emphasizes Zimbabwe as an extraordinarily beautiful nation. Consider using Bonisa Excursions as listed here."
Afternoon Visit
"Came here as part of a visit to the local villages, to watch the sunset and see some esoteric cave paintings. Absolutely worth your time so do not skip this!"
Overnight in Matopos
"A visit to Bulawayo Matopos national park is a great experience for someone needing peace and discover the African nature which provides a variety of bird species, trees, animals, reptiles and not forgetting the paintings, caves which are heavily beefed with so much history."
"Hallo,

As you vcan imagine it is hard to get info about Matobo before you travel.

The Rhino walks you did was this with a National Park ranger? Where / how did you book? How long do they go for? Is there way you can book before hand, or do you need to wait until you arrive at Matobos. We are staying 2 nights in December at the National Parks Maleme Rest Camp. Are the walks in the morning or afternoon - what time do the start?? I am a bit surprised that they walks only cost  $20 - sounds cheap fro Zimanbawe.
What were your highlight of Matobos - game walks, caves, rock paintings, views, dams, swimming holes, picnic place etc
Regards

"Hi, kaiser6. What would you like to know about this attraction?
Id like to get more info about the Rhino trekking; the USD 20 sounds a great deal for 1/2 day. - is this done by Nat Parks or privately. Who do we contact. Are teenage kids allowed to participate?"
how much per person to enter
"Hi, I am planning got visit Matobo and camp in September. We don't have a car so any ideas how we can get there from Bulawayo/ (We are getting a train to there from livingstone) Is there a bus we can get? Would we need a car to travel around the part or is there guided tours? Thanks in advance"
"Hello:

I am interested in visiting Matopo NP, and hope to stay in the Amalinda Lodge.   My questions are about the Rhino tracking for which the park is famous.  I hope someone can answer my questions:
1.  Are Rhino really prevalent in the park and fairy easy to find or is it just a marketing gimmick by them?
2.  I have read that the Rhinos are all de-horned and tagged for conservation reasons.  Is it true they are all de-horned?  Did you see any which are not de-horned?

Thanks

Thank You"
Which is the best campsite to stay in?
"We are travelling to Zimbabwe in August 2015, we have hired a camper van and trying to find the best camp site to try to book in Matobo National Park, we are planning to stay for 2 nights, any suggestions?"
"Hi do not expect any game here unless at Crack of down say 6am you can see the Leopards 
They don't really have any other game was there today 8/9/18
the rock formations and the history is stunning,don't miss that
Dress up in sport wear there is a bit of walking here and there 
The top of grave site is extremely cold so anyone with cold allergy like me should have some shawls or scarf handy"
"Sorry for the late reply, somehow didn't get the notice before today. In case it is still interesting for someone: the rhino tracking is done by the Parks officials. We simply booked it the day before at the park reception. We were able to take our teenage kids (then 13 and 16). And it was well worth it, you could get really close to these animals, and it was very quiet and peaceful. Enjoy"
All info about entry on the website of zimparks
"Sorry, no idea as a local friend brought me there ..."
"Apologies for the delay in answering this , I missed the email. I did not see rhinos on this trip as I was only in the park overnight and out the next morning. I was up at Rhodes grave scattering my mother's ashes.
I have however seen plenty of rhino in the park previously but not been there for some years. Your best bet is to actually phone/email the park and talk to them. Generally in all African parks now they do not like to give out too much information as to where their rhinos are as it is like a red flag to poachers who stop at nothing to get rhino horn."
"Go to Motobo Hills Lodge! (Not sure you could get up the tracks with a camper an though?) It's absolutely stunning; high up with a near 360* view of the STUNNING scenery. Josh, the manager there, is wonderful; incredibly friendly and helpful and he tends to eat with the guests on the Veranda so you can grab loads of local history and info. Campfire often in the evening too! And really beautiful rooms with cheap rates. I'd also recommend tracking rhinos with Ian Harmer of African Wanderer Safaris - our days with him were the highlight of our whole trip."
World Heritage Site
"The Matobo National Park is a must for it’s totally unique, incredibly beautiful landscape of balancing rocks, ancient cave paintings and wildlife. I recommend staying at Maleme Rest Camp owned by Zim Parks. I have been visiting this amazing place since I was a small child in the 1970’s and I can safely say it’s one of the few places in the world that has not been ruined."
Natural beauty at its best
We had the afternoon to spare in Bulawayo so decided to take a drive out to Matopos.The rock formations are amazing . Leaves you wondering how this can be possible.Think the visit to Cecil John Rhodes tombstone should be included. Quite steep price.Another suggestion would be to be able to get a map of the area with distances and sites.Worth going.
Just incredible
"We travelled out to the Matopos on a mild Sunday morning.  A simple entry process and we were on our way around the trail to stop at the various places throughout the park.  I would definitely recommend stopping at the cave drawings, which is between 5 - 10 minutes walk off the track.  There's a nice craft market about half way and we also saw a range of local animals in the wild, including a white rhino being less than 100 metres off the track.  Finishing off at the Matabo Lodge was pleasant with an amazing view looking over the park.  The road is predominantly tarred with the last 5 - 6 kms unmade, which I would recommend taking your time on.  Take a photo of the map at the front gate so you know a bit more about what and where you're going."
Never made it past the gate
"My daughter was home from university and we took her out to Matopos for a family outing. When we arrived we were advised that there was no reception and could not pay with ecocash or swipe. National Parks suggested I drive back towards town and pay when I find reception, which I did, back in town. The banks do not issue cash, I am local and cannot get US$ and fuel is short, surely we should be allowed to pay on our way out? National Parks require full name, ID number, hone address, telephone number, vehicle registration number so it is not as if we cannot be located if we are unable to pay on the day."
A must
This is really a must if you visit the Southern part of Zimbabwe . In the park is the grave of Cecil Rhodes as well as opportunities to SEe wild life. It can Be visites with a sedan.
Amazing
"With a breath of fresh air mesmerising you as you reach fo the mountain top where the view is totally awesome, one can only enjoy the sight and marvel at the great work of creation. A place where one can only wish to return over and over again and literally touch the sky, this is the place to visit."
Jordan the amazing guide
"Wow, wow, wow, one of the best wildlife experiences of my life ... we got so close to a family of rhinos... just lucky!!! So fabulous thanks to Jordan Nel of African Wanderer."
Beautiful place!
"This place is sacred to the local people, and it’s easy to see why - it’s a very beautiful setting, huge boulders, gorgeous views."

The Bald Ones
"Matobo Hills is a World Heritage Site where one will find spectacular granite rock formations, the burial site of the country's founder and on a great day, rhino!No visit to Bulawayo would be complete with including this National Park"
