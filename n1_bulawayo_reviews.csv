review
Very clean and spacious. The atmosphere is exactly as it looks in the images provided on website.  The only problem was noise from the busy street. Otherwise I have no complaints. It is an affordable and safe option when you need to spend a few nights in Bulawayo.
The place was super nice. I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel. I would love to experience the same in Vic Falls. Very great place to be.
"It was a great stay, N1 the staff was polite and the location of the hotel is central. The rooms were clean and warm so was the water. There were also the observance of the WHO guidelines on COVID-19."
"everything was excellent interms of services, cleanliness rooms etc except breakfast, could you at least improve on your breakfast menu, it is always nice to have a variety you could pick from not choosing from two menus early bird and sunrise, and also could you also add starters and desserts just like other hotels."
I enjoyed my stay. I had uninterrupted wifi access and electricity during my stay which helped me as l was on study vacation. An addition of lunch or dinner would make make it more enjoyable. I will definitely come back on my next visit.
This is a clean and modern hotel whose main attraction is location and affordability- all this complimented by the very friendly staff. I will have no second thoughts about staying there again.Highly recommended.
"Your services were good and one can safely say your team is at its best.But to the other hand, there's need to change your type of blankets, try to get modern blankets and if possible you might as well install airconditioners in winter season"
"The stay was good except that the room was a bit cold due to lack of internal heater/air conditioner, no refrigerator and place for hanging cloths. The service, cleanliness and location were excellent."
"I visited the hotel for a business workshop,the standards are different from the harare hotel,the byo one is lower! Water in the shower was not flowing out,the lover windows were not closing properly, unfortunately it was the cold that period."
Beautiful and tranquil.I suggest you provide cell phone chargers which can be kept at the reception.I enjoyed my stay the good is excellent next to none.reception was welcome.will call again next time
My stay at the hotel was wonderful. The reception guys were very friendly. The rooms were clean however the location is not very good. The TV channels should however be increased to differentiate it from other hotels
"the overall place is good juss that the parking is not safe , and also landaury facilities are missing , besides that the place is goodroom 202 needs a plumber the draining of Walter when u bath tends to be slow ,and poor"
"The helpful, friendly staff let us check in really early, which was much appreciated after a long train journey. The hotel is ideally located for the train station and the Intercape bus (right next door). The central location means there's a bit of noise in the morning. The room as very comfortable and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay."
"Nice place to stay which is close to all amenities with honest staff. The rooms are large and self-contained. The place is good if you are passing through Bulawayo with some business commitments in town. Although the place lacks garden facilities, however the big rooms compensate for this. The lack of lifts makes the upper rooms difficult to access. Being close to the noisy traffic makes it not suitable for holding meetings. I did not use the restaurant because it was empty, and the price did not include breakfast which is fine because there is the Haefelisi restaurant about 300 meters away and other take away outlets close by."
I enjoyed my one night stay. The service was excellent and professional from arrival and check-in to check-out. Staff was quick to respond to any queries and requests. I would recommend anyone visiting Bulawayo to book with them.
Your brochure and your website say breakfast is included in room fee but I was made to pay over and above the room fee. This us terrible misinformation or something wrong is happening there. The breakfast was poorly done and was not value for money. The rooms do have closets to hang cloths
"I had a pleasent stay by the Hotel, the rooms are well set and designed of which i was in a comfort zone. I got to relax and have fun at the same time, all in all i can conclude that N1 Hotel is a place to be, it curters for all."
"Very clean , quiet and affordable place to stay.  The staff are friendly and ready to help starting from the reception to the kitchen staff . I wouldnt mind staying there over and over each time u am in bulawayo."
Please consider mini fridges in the rooms why not?? Otherwise the new look rooms are nice and spacious. The reception crew especially Tafara and Actual and Massy were exceptionally nice and good and professional though your wifi tokens easily ran out of data
"Great location, situated conveniently next to Intercape Bus Station. Within walking distance to restaurants and Bulawayo train station. The decent size rooms were spotless. Staff are very friendly and accommodating."
Lovely service the staff was very friendly indeed. The room was excellent. In terms of location the hotel is centrally located to many amenities are within walking distance. Service was lovely and cleanliness was awesome.
"Nice comfortable hotel. We stayed here for two nights whilst visiting Bulawayo. We were able to check in early, room was clean and spacious. Hotel in a good location to the city with most places a 15-20 minute walk. Left our bags on day of departure which was a big help as we were getting an overnight train to Victoria Falls. Only feedback could look at darker curtains as sun came through when it came up."
"i am happy with all other things how ever cant you put a small fridge in your rooms, this will be most welcome , Bulawayo this actually hot and being booked there you have to get a cooler box to cool soft drinks and other stuff, we would appreciate if you review this and also give us feed back on this issue."
N1 is a very functional hotel - a charmless and not very welcoming establishment. It is located centrally but not in a very pleasant part of town - but most things are in easy walking distance. It is right next to the main street and the bus terminus - so you have to put up with the noise of traffic all the time. The rooms are surprisingly spacious and very clean - but the furniture is utilitarian to say the least and there are no cupboards to pack clothes. The toilet in the bathroom is so close to the wall that you basically have to sit side saddle - quite an irritation. The breakfast is very basic and not very nice -  and the restaurant does not function after that. This hotel is fine for an overnight stay or if you are operating on a tight budget - but otherwise I found it depressing staying there for four days.
"The hotel is easily accessible in Bulawayo, rooms kept clean and staff very cheerful and helpful. A few amenities are lacking in the rooms e.g fridge and wardrobe but looking at the price i feel it's okay. The biggest challenge is noise from the streets since the hotel is placed in the CBD."
The room was clean and there are no hussles when you check in and check out. The fact that you provide wifi is a bonus but i think clients must be given access to the wifi when they check in instead of us having to go down yo reception for it
"in my opinion ,carpets provide a more warmly welcome. tiles are okay but i personally think carpets are much better especially if you are staying with kids who would love a run around the room. On the day i slept over, it was very cold and the floor was the same.  my toddler had a tough night.Some things should never have limits especially in the hospitality industry, for instance sugar sachets. When i slept over it was a cold night and made a cup of coffee in the evening and i used up my sugar sachets. In the morning, when i tried to make another cup  of coffee i had to beg for sachets and staff was reserved when they issued me extra sachets.Otherwise nice place, quite convenient location and affordable"
"I find N1 very clean and would recommend it for business travel. I am not sure, however, if it is family friendly. My only complaint was the time it took to check if our payment transfer had been done.. Your accounts people are inefficient. I ended up using my own cash. I was told I would be reimbursed at the end of the month! Not a happy situation for me. I don't even know if the money will be paid."
"had no power the entire night, mosquitoes , a lot of noise the location is bad a lot of areas you need to improve on otherwise we wont be ever be coming back to your hotel. please you need to improve ."
I was very much pleased with th service and the atmosphere at N1 Bulawayo.you are the best guys keep it up.i will keepbin visiting N1 each time i come for my business in Bulawayo and also i will raise you flag up high
"Its was a pleasant experience with the renovations that have been done, the place was fresh. I enjoyed the spaciousness of the room! However noted that water did not drain fast from the shower area. Also would have loved to have the electrical sockets for charging close to the bed side."
"Good budget hotel. Very friendly staff on reception who were willing to help when I explained that my bag hadn't arrived on our flight. Good size rooms. Excellent WiFi. The only downside was the blinds let in loads of light in the morning as well as the purple lights that were illuminating the side of the hotel throughout the night. Just as well, I had eye pads with me."
"It's a good place. Coming back from SA after losing had taken it's toll on me and my wife. We had been trying the rural and back, not rested.We had traveled by road from SA and we were so tired a day exhausted after the funeral. The N1 was just what we needed to recuperate and refresh and we got that plus more."
PLEASE improve on the time lag for serving breakfast we stayed abit long before food was served. Please increase workforce during these time so that people do not stay long waiting. Otherwise everything was good and perfecxt
"The welcome was excellent and the guys are very helpful and friendly.  Keep it up. The rooms were very good.  Breakfast not very good include a wide variety, it was very limited and the same esp if going to Vic falls its boring to have almost same breakfast for the 5 days I stayed in hotel I ended up buying pies from bakeries when I got to Vic Falls coz it was same menu as BYO N1.  The waiter should keep an eye if the cups are available for people having tea.  If its holidays they should be 2 waiters to avoid waiting for too long whilst he prepares the food."
The noise in the early hours of the morning from the traffic  is very annoying and the blinds let in too much light so much that i woke up at 4am thinking it was already 10am. Maybe invest in some sound proofing and block out curtains.Otherwise location is convenient and rooms are clean
Thank u your hotel is beautiful. Very clean and very comfortable. The staff on duty were very pleasant and very polite. Definitely would recommend to all travelers. Parking is safe as they have a 24hr guard. Thank u N1 again
"since they did their renovations, the rooms are looking very lovely and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend anyone passing Bulawayo, or visiting, to stay at N1 - you're guaranteed of a prime location with very helpful service for those who don't know their way around."
"This is a very decent budget hotel. The rooms are spacious, linen generally clean with decent coffee bar. It is centrally located in Bulawayo with some lovely views of the city from the top floor.  I was generally pleased with the experience."
"Renovations are in progress, Having stayed at the hotel before the renovations One positive in the refurbished room was the bathroom. I observe you are removing the kitchen sinks etc which is good but there is no wardrobe anymore. For a guy or family staying for more than a day what are the plans?Educate me thanks"
