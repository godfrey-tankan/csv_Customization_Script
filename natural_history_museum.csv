review
"The museum is a mix of natural history and Zimbabwe history. Unfortunately it looks like nothing was updated since it was first established in 1964.  The history section was written from a Eurocentric point of view, talking about the “bravery” of the white settlers.  When I come to a Zimbabwe museum, I want the local perspective of the establishment of Rhodesia, Cecil Rhodes, the missionaries, etc.  we’re they a positive or negative for the indigenous people?  This part of the museum was a disappointment. Lighting was also not well maintained so much of the displays were in the dark.  The museum has a good set of exhibits at its core, but needs some serious updating.  Nonetheless, worth a visit"
This museum is far larger than we anticipated  and has so much history about the region - we wish we had more time but they kicked us out. You need at least a few hours if you actually want to read into all the stuff they have here. The live snake exhibit is lovely as well.
This museum does a very good job of presenting the history of Zimbabwe from the Stone Age to Today.  It also has an impressive Natural History collection.  The butterfly and insect collection is particularly impressive.  A+
"I visited the Bulawayo Natural History Museum with my family on 13 March 2022. We were the only guests at the museum during our two plus hours’ stay. The museum is very rich in the diversity and variety of mammals, butterflies, birds and geological specimens from numerous geographical areas and habitats within and outside of Zimbabwe. There is a display of live snakes from Zimbabwe and Southern Africa on the ground floor. All the displayed items are appropriately labelled and there are detailed descriptions accompanying some of the displays ( esp the birds and geological specimens) and dioramas. In addition, there are numerous interesting historical artifacts and items from the pre-colonial and colonial era. The whole museum serves as an excellent educational resource. I had read somewhere that this is the best natural history museum in Africa, and it can very well be considering the variety of specimens it hosts, but the museum definitely requires some resources and a modernizing touch. The front desk reception was not manned by a professional, and there were no brochures or fliers handed out to guide us. Even though generally the two floors of the museum were well aired and well lit, the lighting was poor in some areas. There are no audio-visual aides or computerized touch screen catalogues like one sees in more modern and well-resourced museums. There is a small curio shop at the reception which has very few and outdated items, and items were not on sale on the day of our visit, since “the prices of the items had not been recently revised”.  This is a Sunday afternoon well spent for me and my family, and I look forward to another visit when in Bulawayo. I long to see this institution getting the attention it deserves."
The museum is really beautiful but one thing I didn't like was the fact we weren't allowed to take pictures of the artifacts.
"Although in need of some new investment, it's definitely worth a visit. The ground floor has excellent displays of African wildlife (including some really cool old dioramas), including a big display of living snakes, while the top floor has a big display on Zimbabwean history, spanning from prehistory to independence. Well worth a couple of hours if you want to know more about the history of the region and the wildlife of Zimbabwe."
"I remember going there the first time as a kid how the mounted elephant scared me, a good place for the kids to gain some knowledge on nature. Good place to go for a lazy inexpensive weekend outing."
"The place is very amazing it is rich in history.The only letdown is they don't allow cameras for photo shooting.There is the history of the human race with skulls of homo habilis ,homo erectus etc as well as modern history.For history enthusiasts this is the place for you.There are also different varieties of different  live snakes as well  dummy wild animals like lions,elephant ,leopard etc.Also the place is a  3 minute drive from the Bulawayo CBD."
"Now I am not really a museum visitor, however with time to kill along I went. Very pleased I did, mostly natural history, large section on C J Rhodes, & geological section, it really is very well done & for myself just the right amount of information. Oh also live snakes section have to say not keen on this as I feel they should be free."
"Overall, I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this museum but I will point out a few things which I hope may prevent others going there in false expectation. Firstly, be clear that it is far more than just natural history. The sections on the history of this country are excellent and important. The natural history ranges from geology to fungi to insects to stuffed animals (including the second largest mounted elephant in the world) to a display of live snakes. All round, a good variety.Please do not expect a modern, European type museum with lots of buttons to push with videos or computerised displays. That is not meant to detract from the interest of what there is to see, just to ensure no misunderstandings.Rightly or wrongly, please also note that the history section deals with the colonial and pre-colonial eras but nothing since independence. If you are seeking information after 1980, this is not the place. I would also warn that, from my visit anyway, some of the lighting is not what it should be and either labels or exhibits are not as visible as you might want. It may or may not be right to blame the museum authorities but at this stage in Zimbabwe's progress, do not hold it against them! Yes, there are also parts which are quite old and could do with renovation but a lot of it has either stood the test of time or has been smartened up recently. Do not be to judgemental!The current temporary display is on postcards. There are interesting exhibits but I feel it is not as clearly explained as it could be.There is a cafe. I doubt it has a great variety but I am sure it is fine if you are not fussy or just want a cup of tea as I did.The museum does try to host special events as and when it can, so look out for those if you are in Bulawayo.You could dash round in an hour or spend 2-3 hours trying to absorb everything that there is to see.The cost is US$10 for non-resident visitors, Z$5 for locals. I do believe it is worth a visit."
Great exhibits well worth spending time on. I never figure why they are so strict about taking photographs though ... spoils the mood a bit ...
Excellent day out for the whole family. Amazing learning experience with well maintained facilities and exhibits.
A lovely family outing. when with two teen Boys whom were amazed and keeped busy throughout. even it old still amazing people there running it Keep up the good work
"This is a wonderful museum! It has taxidermy examples of the local wildlife, from large to small, mammals, reptiles, & birds! In the central courtyard are housed live snakes, and there are excellent exhibits about the local culture and industries upstairs."
Brilliantly kept one of the best in this family of museums. Take the whole family for some hours of learning. My kids loved it
"This museum is a must see in Bulawayo. The depiction of the history of Zimbabwe from pre colonial times through the colonial era through UDI to the present date history is well depicted. The collection of Zimbabwean animals is amazing, the geology exhibition is great and the live snakes awesome."
"We had experienced seeing a few snakes at our lodge in the Matopos and the Lodge Manager suggested we pop in here to see a Black Mamba, Green Mamba, Spitting Cobra and a Boomslang amongst many others. It was pretty amazing and there seemed to be so much more here that would have been worth a wander round but we didnt have the time unfortunately. We definitely were glad we had chance to see the live snakes though."
A very interesting museum highlighting Zimbabwean history. Very well preserved and meticulously kept. True to life statues of well know names in Zimbabwean history. A real treasure. So many things to see and in each section a different feel.  It has to be seen to appreciate it!! So glad I visited.
"As a geologist by training I gravitate to Natural History museums.  This one did not disappoint.  The geological descriptions and displays on the Zimbabwe were themselves outstanding, but the general introduction to rocks and environments was some of the best I have ever seen.   The ""visit"" down a mine and its displays (coal, asbestos, gold, etc) were super.   So well done, Bulawayo Natural History Museum.   The snakes were pretty cool too."
One of the best places to visit in Bulawayo if you're looking to entertain yourself. Well kept and very informative. I thought the snakes were artificial but then they moved!!! Definitely pass through while in Bulawayo
Nice place for 2 hours in bulawayo
Outstanding
The snakes are alive!
didnt expect it to be such a great museum
Plenty of information and interesting display
Nice Museum
Wonderful museum
Wonderfull place to learn a lot about history animals and again Cecil Rhodes. Just walk around. Impressing the real big elefant at entrance worth to be seen. And the living snakes incl. Black mambas I happened to see in reality next day at matopo np. Unfortunately photograph is forbidden in the museum do not know why. But worth a visit you can easily visit railway museum same afternoon.
A very inspiring place full of history and culture. It gives people direction and a sense of belonging as they get to know how they came to be.
It was a good visit and the pricing was fairly ok. I never knew that the snakes were alive and not for display until I saw them moving. The mine cave also is interesting with a man statue who seems so real. Soo educative.
We went here not expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised take a guide tour of the museum.. their have a large collection and you can easily spend a few hours here.
I arrived pretty late (they close at 17:00) so I couldn't visit all the museum. The entrance fee for internationals is 10 USD but if you like nature it's worth it. There are many stuffed animals that make you feel in the real bush. The information provided concerns mainly Zimbabwe so there are some mammals from the rest of southern Africa missing. the collection of birds is something remarkable too. There are life reptiles and many more information. Perfect to go with kids in a very hot day!
Quite a good history  here loved being there it was fun to know  some things that I didn't know and good guides they were so good at what they  were doing and I really liked it
We spent about two hours in this museum and throughly enjoyed it. I would recommend it as Bulawayo's premier tourist attraction. The displays are well maintained and the social history galleries in particular are very informative.

"This museum is kept to high standards and the artifacts and animals in the displays are well preserved.  I enjoyed it so much the first time, that I have been back 3 more times. The staff are helpful and friendly and you can learn a lot if you give yourself a few hours to stroll through all the different sections."
Old needs to keep up with the times. I visited it for the first time when i was doing a school trip 20 years ago. Nothing has changed. There should be more content to get visitors excited . Surrounding gardens also need help with upkeep.
