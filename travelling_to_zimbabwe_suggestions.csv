Is it safe to travel to Zimbabwe?
"How long is a piece of string? Yes it is safe to travel to Zimbabwe and you will read numerous posts from people on this forum that have had a wonderful time in Zimbabwe and have felt perfectly safe not even aware of any problems.



But like anywhere in the world there are isolated incidents and sadly Zimbabwe is no exception to this. Millions of tourists visit the country every year and incidents are very very rare. So I would honestly say it is a safe destination as long as you don't go off into some remote location, without someone who knows the place well."
Thank u very much BooPeel.
"no its a horrible dangerous place, if you go there you will definitely be mugged, shot, stabbed, set alight, eaten by cannibals, tortured, crucified, stoned to death, locked up and then be fed to a pack of hungry lions.



If i were you, i'd stay at home!

go and have an awesome time! its a brilliant country. As a british person, i was concerned the first time i went (back in 2005) but have been back 3 times since then!"
"I live here, and I would say it is safer than most places, just don't be silly and go walking some where at night. Take taxi's in the towns, the Pathfinder bus between cities, or hire a (ta && ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-45552087', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression');car for your own freedom. Cities don't get gridlock very often (in fact only Harare sometimes). Watchout for the potholes and traffic light that sometimes don't work. The water is safe to drink, the people are friendly and there are some good restuarants around. Do your research, and you will find a beautiful place. Just remember, it is still africa, and not first world. Enjoy your adventure"
I just had the most wonderful trip to Zimbabwe and Zambia. Unbelievable! Beautiful people and the wildlife was a dream come true. Having a good guide helps. We used Benson Siyawareva...with Ngoko Safaris. Super smart and friendly and organzied. Great story teller and knows the bush like the back of his hand. Best trip ever!!
"Yes – I have been to Zimbabwe many times. I have never once felt unsafe. I took my wife and teenage daughters on a nine day safari in Zimbabwe in 2011 visiting Mana Pools, Hwange, and Victoria Falls. When we were in Victoria Falls they all walked around town without me while I relaxed at the VF Hotel pool. I was not worried at all. I returned to Zimbabwe in September 2012 and the situation seems to be improving.

"We also went to Zimbabwe in 2011. We never felt that we were in an unsafe position. Guides are superb! We found people to be truly kind with a great sense of humor. In Victoria Falls, we visited the craft market and walked in town ourselves with no problem, however there are tourist police in case you would like some assistance. I know that people are concerned about the politics of the country, but I felt that our money was going to many people in the country, not as a support of their dictator. We absolutely loved the national parks and Victoria Falls. I'd go back in heartbeat! (We're in our 60s and retired.)"
"Zimbabwe is one of the safest countries in Africa for tourists. The biggest risk is from (ta && ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-49783369', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression');car accidents, just like in developed countries. Zimbabwean people are generally very friendly and generous, and will go out of their way to help rather than hinder you. I've written more about it here: http://www.greatzimbabweguide.com/safe-in-zimbabwe/"
"Travelling in Zimbabwe is relatively safe, I would say not more dangerous than in any of the surrounding countries, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique or especially South Africa. The major towns are connected by luxury buses, Pathfinder being one, that bring you from Harare to Bulawayo, Hwange and Victoria Falls. In Harare it is difficult to find your way, but get a taxi or hire a driver and (ta && ta.queueForLoad ? ta.queueForLoad : function(f, g){document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', f);})(function(){ta.trackEventOnPage('postLinkInline', 'impression', 'postLinks-50118979', '');}, 'log_autolink_impression');car and it will take you anywhere."
"Would it be safe to travel by public transport and stay in budget places, being a mixed couple (Western European + Malawian, speaking fluently Shona)? I'm a bit worried that I'll be causing trouble for locals with my murungu presence."
