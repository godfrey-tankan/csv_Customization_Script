"Since I was a kid more than a half century ago, I wanted to see Victoria Falls. I finally did, and I was not disappointed. The national park on the Zimbabwe side has a cliff top trail that provides plenty of spectacular viewing opportunities for the falls and its many components. The immensity of the falls is so,etching that needs to be experienced first hand. A poncho is a must unless you want to get completely soaked to the skin (not necessarily a bad thing if it is very hot). There was a fair bit of natural shade available, and it wasn’t particularly hot when we were there. This is a sight that definitely should not be missed.",2021-01-22
"An awesome, inspiring experience that will overwhelm even the seasoned traveller. I had high expectations, however, didn't expect to be blown away.A visit should take about two hours with several viewing areas along the way for the all important pictures.Nobody seems to be disappointed with the falls themselves, however $50USD is a bit steep. That said, the parks department know they have a captive audience. It's the reason you are there. Still, a great experience.",2016-08-13

"Vic Falls is just incredible. You can see a millions pictures but they could never do the views justice. It is just amazing, the sheer amount of water and power of it all. The view points provided are all stunning and we'll worth taking the time over. Guides available but perhaps not necessary, information boards also provided at the entrance. Awesome place and a must see.",2021-08-05

"The Falls are totally breathtaking and amazing. The park itself has good paths and is wheelchair accessible. However, it has been said it previous reviews that the entrance fee for “foreign visitors” at USD50 is a rip off. There is no proper queueing system, no printed ticket, no map given.. just a hustle through the gate and off you go. Wheelchair hire from the car park across the road another USD30 .. be prepared to part with your cash to add this to your tourist bucket list!! Worth seeing but …",2018-07-15
"The Victoria Falls were on our bucket list and they did not disappoint. What a wonderful experience, so happy I was able to make the trip with my family. The falls are absolutely exquisite, from the rock formations, the multiple rainbows and rain forest. Photos don’t do it justice, it’s something you have to see for yourself.",2023-03-15
"Mosi-oa-Tunya is the Zimbabwe name for the Victoria Falls, which means 'the smoke that thunders'. Our visit was in the dry season, which means the water flow doesn't cover the full 1.7km width of the falls. Nevertheless, the obvious power and force of the VF is still incredibly impressive and justifies being one the 7 wonders of the world. The downside is the cost of visiting VF via Zimbabwe and Zambia. In addition to the cost of travel and hotels, you are required to pay on arrival at Zimbabwe airport a visa charge of UD$75pp, then US$50pp to enter the falls on the Zimbabwe side and a further US$20pp on the Zambia side, which for two of us was a total of US$290. If you choose to have a guide, you will need to employ one in each location. Having said all that, the once in a life time experience is very special and still worth the visit.",2023-04-20
